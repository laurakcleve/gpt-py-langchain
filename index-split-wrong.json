[{"content": "Hello and welcome to Swashbuckling with Code, I'm Jimmy Cleveland. In this video, we're going to cover the basics of publishing your first package, which includes publishing a scoped package. I'll have to assume that you already have Node installed and that you're familiar with the basics of installing packages, but that's really all you need to know to get going on this one. So I'm going to be showing creating a new NPM account so you can publish packages to it and just how easy it is to publish your first package and install it in a new project. Then I'm going to explain when and how you can unpublish a package, and I'll show that real quick. And then we'll switch over to using scoped packages so that we're not polluting the NPM registry namespace with a bunch of names that can never be used, just in case you're messing around and creating your own example packages for practice. I think it's a more polite thing to do. And now that you know what this video is about, let's publish a package. We're going to start by creating a really simple project that we can publish up to NPM and then install somewhere else so we can see this working in an action. So to do that, I'm going to create a directory. You can do that however you like. I'm going to use mkdir, and I'm going to just name it swashbuckling package example. I'm going to cd into that directory. At that point, I'll just open it with my code editor of preference vs code. It looks like it has to install an update. Great. So then in here, we're just going to create a file that's in index.js, you know, the basics of basics here, and I'm just going to console.log test package logs to console. Really, really simple just to make it do something here. We can go back to our terminal, and I can say node index.js just to run it in node and you can see that it logs to our console as expected. So after that, we probably want to make it a package. So I'm going to use npm init, and I'm not going to pass the dash y flag to say yes to everything this time because we actually do want to answer the questions here. So this is sort of a wizard to walk you through creating your package. So the package name will by default be the same as the directory that you made, which I'm going to go with. Then it's going to have the version here. Now I'm actually going to set my version to 0.1.0, which I'll explain in a moment. A description if you want to have one. Example package, please don't install. The entry point if you want to change it. So by default, it's going to be index.js. And that's why I created that file there in the root. We don't really care about a test command for this right now. And then a git repo. Not yet. Keywords is going to be useful if you want people to be able to search for it for specific things. So we could put, you know, example here if we wanted people to find it, or perhaps it's, you know, a React or Vue framework or Svelte or something like that. In this case, I don't want it to be found, so I'm not gonna put anything. And then the author be myself. I'll fill that in a moment. The license gets kind of tricky. It kind of depends on what you're doing. So I'm just going to leave it with default for now. We won't worry about it yet. So now we can confirm that everything looks fine. Yes, it does. Just press enter. Now, in order to actually publish this package, we're going to need an npm user for the registry for it to be assigned to. So I, of course, already have one. If you do npm who am I, it should print out who you are or if you're logged in. So this is my own, but I'm going to show you making a new one. So I'm going to npm log out, which if you want to see the list of commands, you can do npm dash dash help. And when you do that, it'll print out a bunch of stuff. Some of it's related to just installing packages and some of it's actually related to like your account. So we're going to be using publish pretty soon, but you can also see a login and a log out. And here's our who am I that we ran. So now when I run npm who am I, it will say this command needs you to be logged in. So that's what you're going to see if you didn't already have an account. So next, what we can do is we'll go over to the browser here and I already have npmjs.com open. You can just Google for it or go straight there. And this is where we need to create our account. So we can just do the sign up for free. There is an enterprise npm, but for most people, you're not going to be using that. And they're going to ask us to create some sort of username, which they'll identify us with, and then an email and a password. So mine's going to be crazy long. I'm gonna do swashbuckling with code. And then I'm gonna fill in my details and log in. And it's automatically going to redirect me to here. And I do believe you have to verify your email address before you can publish your first package. But let's test it and see. So now we can head back over to our terminal and try to log in as that user. So I'll do npm log in. It's going to prompt me for my username and then my password. Then it's going to ask for the email that I use for the account. And then it'll say I'm logged in. So if I do npm who am I, we're logged in. Before we publish the first package, I have to make a quick disclaimer here, you're probably going to want to hold off on publishing your own package and the steps that I'm about to do. Because it can actually be pretty difficult to remove a package from the npm repository. It's a nice thing that it's so easy and frictionless to actually get your own package up. But the problem is that once you push up a package, that name is reserved. So I would ask that if you are going to publish your own package, you try to pick a name that really no one's going to have like your username with package example, kind of like I've done. And I'm going to show how to unpublish that package. But if that package is used by someone else on the registry, you cannot unpublish it. And I haven't verified yet if you unpublish the package if someone else is able to reuse that name. I imagine they can, but I haven't confirmed that. Right after I show how to unpublish a package, I'm going to show how to make a scoped package. And that's a great time to follow along. A scoped package is going to let you tie package names to your username or your company name. And that'll make it to where you don't have to worry about taking up unscoped package names. I'll talk more on that when we get there. You of course can if you want to publish up your own package as you're following along. But I'm just recommending that as a courtesy to people because we could flood, you know, the market with a bunch of package names that then no one could ever use and don't ever get used. I might be overly cautious in this area. But now that I've explained that, let's move on with the video. So now that we have an account, it's pretty easy actually to publish. Let's try and see if we can yet. So you'll notice that we get this forbidden message here. And it's going to say, in most cases, you or one of your dependencies are requesting a package version that is forbidden by your security policy or on a server you do not have access to. So this is a pretty generic error here, unfortunately. So let's see if we verify the email, if that solves it for us. So in my inbox, I have this notification here, this email from NPM asking me to verify my email address. So I'm going to go ahead and do that. And then just do continue. And now we're verified. Let's see if we can publish now. And there you go. So I really wish that they would list that a little bit better. But it is in the documentation that you do have to verify in order to publish a package to the registry. So now if we go to our account here on the top right, you can click this profile or packages. If we go to packages, you'll see that our package is actually listed here. Swashbuckling package example. If I click on that package, sometimes that'll take a while if it's brand new. It'll take me over to what you would normally see when you look up a package here. And it's going to auto fill the readme if you have that in your project and a lot of that type of stuff. It'll even show the GitHub repo if it's over here. And it will tell you how to install it. So we can click this to copy it to our clipboard and see if we can install it in a new project. So now I'm going to open up a new tab. So in this new tab, I'm going to create a new directory as well. I'll cd into my vids directory to do that. And we're just going to name this something local like package consumer. We're not actually going to publish this one. cd into that as usual. And so I'm just going to start with an npm init. I'll just do dash y because I don't care about that in this case. And let's see if we can install that package. So I can actually paste from my clipboard here, this npm i that I copied from the site. And it says that we've installed the package. So let's open it up in code and see. Go to our package JSON. And you'll see that we have this one dependency installed since I didn't use any flags to install it. So we'll say this swashbuckling package example 01. Okay, and then let's really quickly use it. So I can create a new file index.js or whatever you like. So because I haven't made a function or anything like that, I can simply just import it here. So I'll say require and then it should auto complete for me. And let's just do that. And I go back to my terminal, I can run node index.js, and boom, logs to the console. So it's really that easy to publish a package. So overall, I think it's a pretty good thing how easy it is to publish up a package. And you can see the benefits of that with the massive ecosystem that is the npm registry, and how much JavaScript as a whole has evolved because of it. But there is some debate in the community on how frictionless it should be, you know, how much more authentication should we have and accountability and all that type of stuff. And then not to mention the problem of, you know, stealing names really easily and then never being able to use them. And there was a time where you could actually just easily remove your package from npm. But then there were a couple of incidents where packages were removed that tons and tons and tons of other packages and projects depended upon and it broke all of them. So now they make it a little more difficult to remove your package. And they don't even let you if it's installed in other packages on the registry as far as I know. So let's get back to that version thing. In our actual package project, we had this version set to 0.1.0. And I said I would explain that later. Well, it's later. So this right here, by default, it starts you as one. And that's pretty normal. This is semantic versioning, which I'll cover in a later video. But the idea here is that they want you to start on a major version, and I'm starting it on a minor. This is a common way of signaling that your package isn't ready to be used as like an everyday package, or that it's not stable yet. So when you're ready for it to be completely consumed by users, you would change this to one, which you can use with version flags. So now I'm going to show how to unpublish this package. And then we're going to use scoped packages, which, in my opinion, is a little bit more polite if you're just doing, you know, example throwaway packages. It's pretty good for testing. And I also use that in a lot of my package conventions. So let's get to that. So we go back to our terminal here, we can simply put npm on publish. Now we're going to get this error because you either have to pass a version that you want to unpublish, or you have to pass this dash dash force flag to unpublish the whole package. So when I do that, you can see it goes through successfully. If in this other project that I had over here, the package consumer, if I were to publish that up, and it was using that previous package that we were just on, it actually wouldn't let me unpublish it. I thought about showing that, but it kind of increases the length of the video. So you can take my word for it or look it up. So back to this. Now that we've unpublished it, do you think we can republish it again? Let's see. Oh, that's interesting, huh? This message is actually useful this time. It says cannot be republished until 24 hours have passed. So what we've created at this point is called an unscoped package. And there's two types of scoped packages, actually. There are public ones and private ones. And for private, you need an enterprise account. So we're just going to do the public one for now. So you can actually put the at symbol in front of it to make it a scope. And then you can put a slash for the package name. So this is saying that I'm going to have multiple packages under this at swashbuckling scope, most likely. And then this is the individual package name. And that's how people will install it with this name. So now let's try to publish this. So you're going to see that we get this payment required, which immediately kind of sends the wrong signal. And I wish they didn't do this. It is required if you're going to do an enterprise one. And what you're actually going to need to do is you're going to need to pass a flag for the first time that you publish this. So if you do npm publish, you can do dash dash access public, publish publish. Now that gets us further, but it says the scope is not found. So the point of this was to show that if you're not doing an organization level account, you're going to have to use your username for the package. So I did this at swashbuckling, but I actually need to put the full username here. So that's in this code base here. So we'll say at swashbuckling with code. It's very long. Now, if we run this exact same command again, it then publishes successfully. So now we can go back to our browser. And we have zero packages because we unpublished that old one. But if we refresh, we now have this scoped package. So now this is scoped to your user. So you can feel pretty confident that you can throw up as many as you want. And you're not going to be polluting, you know, npm with a bunch of names that can't ever be taken by anyone else. But again, these packages are public. So anyone could install them or look them up. Unless you're using an enterprise account, which you pay for in that case, then you can make a package private. That'll wrap up this video. I hope that that was useful. Because when I was first learning to do this, all of these errors were extremely not helpful, especially when I wanted to get into scope packages and stuff like that. So I hope that that clears some of that up. In the next video, we're going to go over versioning, what semantic versioning is, and how to increase the version of your", "name": "npm-first-package.txt", "vector": [0.009320788085460663,

I'm Jimmy Cleveland and today I want to take you on a little tour of the Github CLI. In particular, I'm going to show you some practical commands that I've been using more and more to speed up my workflow. Many of you might not even know that there is a CLI tool for Github that you can use in your terminal, but many of you probably do know about it and you just haven't really dug into it or just didn't seem super practical to you or use it for a command here and there if you're anything like me. But recently I tasked myself with trying to dig into it a little bit more and incorporate it in my workflow. And I have to say that there's a few commands that I have a hard time living without now. So let's just jump into it, shall we? To get started with Github CLI you're gonna head over to CLI.github.com. I'll put a link in the description and I'm not gonna go through the setup for that. That's not what this video is for, but you can see they have a couple of commands that you can use to install it. Just know that you are gonna probably want to set up an auth token with SSH and go through that whole process of logging in, but it's pretty simple. CLI docs themselves are pretty hit-or-miss, honestly. They do have all the commands listed off on the side, but there's not a great search and sometimes some commands you would think are in one section or another. You have to click around a lot to figure them out and sometimes the output doesn't really show you what you can really do with the command, which I think is what's really missing. Some of them are great. Like I think the PR list one shows the output itself, which I really like just to kind of quickly see, oh, okay, when I input these commands, this is generally how they're used and what I'm gonna get back. But that's why I made this video. I'm gonna show you some practical commands. And then if you get interested in the GitHub CLI, you can dig into the manual itself and see if there's any commands that interest you. Now I'm gonna kick this off with one of my favorite commands that I think really showcases the power of the GitHub CLI and how much it can improve your workflow. And that is the gh repo create command. Now I'm using a snippet here in this clip to showcase the power of it and how fast but just with a few keystrokes, I can create a repo and I can set it to private and I could push it up immediately without having to do the clunky interface that you normally do where you go into the browser and you have to create a new repo and then you copy the lines that you need to do for, you know, a project that you've already started and been working on. But you're just like, okay, now it's a pretty good point to push this up. Super fast, super useful. This is one of the main commands that I like to use all the time. Now you can use the gh repo list command. I only use this just to see that my repo has been created so I don't have to go to the browser. I mean, I'll see that GitHub CLI demo at the top there. And if I don't really know what command to use, you can use help on any subsection or any argument of the gh-cli. So in this case, I'm kind of looking and I see, oh, well, there's an edit command. What does that do? Well, this is actually pretty cool because if I made a repo and let's say it's private and I wanted to switch it to public, I can just go gh repo edit and I can go down to the visibility and then I can just select public and it's done. That one's actually quite a few steps to do in the web UI. Now I told you I was going to show you how I created that snippet and I'm personally using Raycast on the Mac and you can see here. I've got a little snippet that's just gh rc shortcut. And what's cool about it is I have it move my cursor back to where it's supposed to put the name of the repo automatically when I type it in. You of course can use any shortcut tool you like, but in combination with snippets, this is a really powerful tool. Another common workflow for me that I use the GitHub CLI for is when I want to make a new branch and push up for a PR really quickly. So in this instance, like I'm creating a new commit real quick, I've just added a new feature or whatever and I want to make a PR really fast. I can simply type gh pr create and it'll ask me if I want to push up my branch if I haven't already. It then walks you through a little wizard each time, which is actually pretty useful because if you want to change the title or let's say that you want to create the PR as a draft, these are really useful little quick features you can do. You can also open it in the browser real quick if you just rather do it there. Just like that, you've got a PR created automatically. You can use the gh pr view command to look at the PR and see if any checks are running or just any information about the PR in general. I'll show you checks in a moment. But what's really cool then is you can use the gh pr edit to go back and edit your command so you don't have to go into the browser to do that either. In this case, I'm using it to add some reviewers to a PR that I've already created. And you'll see now when I use the gh pr view command, it shows those reviewers as part of the information for that pull request. Another handy pull request command is gh pr list and this lists out all of the pull requests for your project, which is super handy. There's also an alias gh pr ls for it. And once you've listed all those out, they all have the numbers so you can use gh pr view and then pass it a number to look at any pull requests, not just the one that's the branch that you're on. Now this next one is one of my favorites because it merges a bunch of really common commands into one and that's gh pr merge. And so what this will do is ask you how you want to merge the current branch that you're on and it will default into the the main branch that you're using. It will then prompt you if you want to delete the branch both locally and on GitHub, which keeps your repository nice and clean. And then it merges it in, it checks out the main branch for you, and then it also pulls down the main branch with the updates. So this is a common operation that I just always want to do is, you know, usually I go into the browser and I merge it and then in my terminal I go and I check out main and I pull down and it just does all these things in one nice little command and that's why it's one of my favorites. You can also use the pr merge command on branches that you don't have checked out. So if you do gh pr list or ls, you can list out all of the PRs and then you can just pick the number, so gh pr merge the number, and you can merge a different one if you like to. Now what's cool about this is it's not going to let you merge if there's conflicts or if the checks aren't completed or anything like that. So you don't have to worry about that problem. So let's say that I went to merge this PR and it wouldn't let me. And unfortunately, it doesn't give you that many details if you don't check it out. So I'll gh pr checkout the number, which is another handy little one. And then from there what I can do is I can run merge again on the branch that I'm on and it'll give me a little more information on what's wrong with it. It might be checks or it might have a conflict and it, in this case, it gives me actual command that I can use to run to pull down it locally and resolve those conflicts. So here I'm just demoing a common workflow for me that the GitHub CLI has sped up significantly. And you can see when I try to merge this again, I haven't pushed up my changes and it gives me some additional information that the branches have diverged. So that's pretty cool. And once your conflict is resolved, you push it up, you run the lovely merge command, and it does all the automation of checking out your main branch and pulling down and all that good stuff. And just to show you that I'm going to do a git log here. And you can see here that we have all the commits that we just recently did into the main branch. Another really handy command that's similar to pr list is the pr status command. What I like about this one is it kind of gives you the list of the PRs that affect you. So it will show you the current branches PR that you're on. It will show you all PRs created by you, and it will show you any that are requesting a code review from you. I've only recently been incorporating this one in my workflow, but I have found it to be quite helpful and I'm starting to use it more and more. I don't typically just kind of run it over and over to see if there's anything waiting for me. My kind of workflow is that I have the GitHub app on my phone, and when I get a notification, I can just glance at it real quick. And instead of picking up my phone and looking at it at all, I just know that it's likely to be a PR and I can just tab over to the terminal, run that command real quick and see if there's anything waiting for me. The next thing I want to show with pull requests is how the CLI tool can be useful for workflows, like your tests, you know, Linton test or any continuous integration actions that you're running. So here I'm making a commit that's purposely going to fail our tests and creating a PR for that real quick, just to fire off that continuous integration. And I just kind of showcase here that you can also add a body real quick, and you can switch the CLI to use the editor of your choice. It starts off with nano, but you can use vim or emacs or whatever you like. But what happens when I submit this PR, which is still awesome and super fast, if I go to list it, if I list it too fast, it's not going to actually update with the workflows because it hasn't finished starting all that up just yet. So if you wait a moment, though, you can use gh PR views, the one that I normally use, and you can see that it says checks pending, you can also list out your workflows, but I haven't really found that to be super useful for me. Maybe y'all will find something cool. But I usually just stick to gh PR view. And where this is useful is mostly just multitasking. Like I can just fire that up. And I can be like, okay, the checks are pending. Let me go and do some additional work or whatever I was doing in another tab. And then I can come back and I can just check that real quick. And I'm like, Oh, no, all my checks are failing. And you can also see here if we use gh PR status, it will show our failing checks for branches that we might not even be on just any PR that we've created. So if you end up moving over to a new branch and working, that's a great command just to see like, oh, shoot, my other branch that I just created, it's failing. Gosh, darn it. Of course, once you fix that locally and push it up, all of your workflows will run again. And you could just use the gh PR view command again. And this time you should see that all of your workflow checks are passing. And as I mentioned previously, if you try to merge something that the status checks to workflow checks are not passing, well, then it will just not allow you to. So it of course does obey the rules of your repo. Another really handy set of commands from the CLI for me personally are the gist commands. This just actually makes just a lot more useful to me, because I can just create them on the fly. In this case, I'm just kind of showing that I can point it to a file that I just want to upload because I'm like, oh, this is a good example of how to do a thing that I'll probably forget how to do in the near future. And just with this command, you can hurry up and create a gist. You can also use gh gist list to list out all of your gists, gist list. And then that allows you to run the gh gist view command with an ID of the gist. There might be a more handy way to do it, but that's just usually how I do it. Now it will print that gist out into your terminal. So you can do some fun stuff from there, like pipe it into some sort of syntax highlighter. In this case, I'm just using NPX because I don't have it locally installed just to show the power of it that you can do just on the fly. But what it's really handy for for me is actually sending it into a file. Now this is of course on Nix based systems. You'd have to figure out how to do it on Windows, but I can just, you know, since it's downloading that and printing it out into the terminal, I can just send it into a file. And the only problem that I have with that is that it also kind of prints the description into the file. So I just have to go in and delete that description real quick. Another handy way to do this is the gist clone command. And the one thing that I don't like about this command is that it makes you create a directory, which is just kind of weird. I usually don't want that. I just want to put all the files in one thing, but I haven't figured out how to do that yet. But it's still really nice. It doesn't have that previous problem of, you know, inputting the description into the file. And if you have, you know, multiple files that you want to dump in just one relegated area, well, it works pretty well. You can of course pick the flavor that you like. Now I'm going to round this video off with a command that is actually not that practical, not one that I use very often, but it shows some of the power if you're kind of an automation nut or you are putting together some programs that are using the GitHub CLI under the hood. So you can use the gh search repos command and you can pass it tags or names or anything like that, that you want to do to search for certain types of repos. Now, in this case, I'm showing there's this AWS shell repo that I found at the top of the list here. Now that's a pretty simple command. It's not that useful. In general, you can use a repo view to take a look at that repo and it will show you the readme, which sometimes is really nice. If you're just looking for a command real quick, I could see some practical use for that. But what's really cool is that you can actually take the output and turn it into JSON and you can use a comma separated list to pick the properties that you want to put in JSON. So in this case, I want to know the watchers. I want to know the created at date. I want to know the updated at date, et cetera. And maybe I'm going to do some sorting or something like that. Again, not something I'm trying to pass off as super practical that you're going to use. I just think it's pretty cool to see that there is a lot of power and probably some really neat things that you can do with this command line. That's all I've got for you today. Hopefully this has interested you in taking a further look at the GitHub CLI and seeing if it's useful in your workflow. Maybe it is, maybe it's not. Go ahead and tell me in the comments if you've got any cool little tips that you like to use it for. But with that, thanks for watching and I hope to see you in the next one.", "name": "gh-cli.txt", "vector": [0.00021506196935661137, 0.005407514050602913, 0.009556994773447514, -0.016056833788752556,

"Welcome to another Swashbuckling with Code, I'm Jimmy Cleveland, and today we're going to go over Jest and its test coverage functionality, and we're going to use these coverage reports to sort of clue us into what we should be testing next and how much confidence do we have in our codebase. As you'll see throughout this video, I'm a big fan of coverage reports, and in particular using it in a sort of Continuous Integration fashion through your GitHub Actions or your Bitbucket Pipelines or whatnot. I'm going to be showing a little bit of that toward the end, just so you can see the sort of cool functionality of it, but for the rest of it, what we're going to go over is how to use a coverage report, how to configure it to let you know how many files in your project are lacking coverage based on your specifications of what you want to cover, and we'll also configure some thresholds for what we consider to be sufficient for not only, you know, global coverage of the whole project itself, but maybe individual files or folders that need a little bit higher or a little bit lower coverage. I think to understand it better than that, it's easier just to see it in action, so let's start. So I've gone ahead and created this example repo to speed things up, and let me take you for a spin of it so you kind of know what's going on here. First thing you're going to want to see is that we have these scripts, and these scripts are going to say test, test watch, and test CI. So this is just your standard Jest run. This is going to be a Jest with watch just because I don't want to pass the additional flags every time, and the CI one in particular is going to be for our continuous integration, which is pretty standard, and that's going to be delved into a little bit later with GitHub actions. The only other thing you really need to know in this file is that we have Jest installed as a dev dependency. These are the only dependencies we have at all, any packages, and this at types Jest, and if you're wondering why that's there, that's typically because if you're not getting auto completion and VS code for all of your Jest statements like expect and stuff like that, if you install the types for it, then you typically will. Now the next step is going to be the source folder, and we have various different things. We have a utils folder with a few things, and then at the root we have just this generate item, and we already have a single test written for it. Now each of these methods I'm going to go into, or I should say files, I'm going to go into and look at all of the different functions in them as we need to, but for just a start, what we are starting with is this silly example I've created of a generate item that I put just a bunch of conditional checks for demo purposes, and so you're going to call it and it's going to give you back an object of like a base weapon or a base armor with some random generated stats. It's probably not the greatest example in the world, but you'd be surprised at how long it takes to come up with a decent example that is, you know, a good balance between contrived so that it is understandable, you know, but kind of not really realistic. But if it's too realistic, then it takes too long to get into and really understand all of it. So I think that this strikes a pretty good balance, hopefully. So just bear with me. So at this point I'm going to hop back over to the terminal here, and I'm going to run npm t for just a shorthand for running the test command, and you can see that all our tests pass. Now the scenarios that I want you to imagine here as we're going through this code is that you're either a person who just wrote this and you're kind of wondering what should I test next, or let's say that you are a maintainer or a co-developer or someone else on a team that peer reviews this code and you're trying to kind of figure out what's the stability of it, or maybe you're wanting to either refactor or fix some of the code and you want to know what parts you can remove, and a really good first step to that is writing tests for those things. And I think that coverage really comes in fantastically here, because it's going to give you a good idea of what all of the code that is in the code base is actually covered by tests. Now I have some notes on what covered actually means, but I think it'd be better for me to just kind of show you what it looks like first, and then we can talk to that aspect. So what we can do is we can take our npm t command or test, and then we can use the dash dash to pass another flag to it, and then we can say dash dash coverage. And there you'll see that we'll get our first very interesting coverage report, which is nicely printed out in the terminal. So that's the usage of the dash dash coverage property. And if you're on yarn, you could actually just do yarn test dash dash coverage, you don't have to pass the additional dash dash just so you know, and of course you could also make a script that does that for you. Now at a quick glance, we get some pretty good information here, we can see that it says that source utils is completely covered. The helper.js is the one that it's tested in there. And we'll come back to that in a moment. But the statements, branches, functions, and lines are 100% covered. So you know, statements are any individual statement of code lines, it the lines are going to be a little bit different than statements sometimes, but usually they kind of line up. Functions obviously is pretty obvious, I think, and the branches are just conditional logic, you know, such as ternaries, or if statements, or switch statements, or anything like that. It's even nice, because it shows you the covered line numbers, in case you just want to zip right over to those. But you can see in the rest of our stuff, this, this all files is telling us this is like global coverage, this is what it considers our entire code base that's tested. And it's telling us that, you know, only 35% of our branches are covered, which it's giving the red color to kind of alert you to that. And then, you know, we're getting into the warning state for some of this other stuff. If we go in individually to generate item, you can see this is pretty feature paired up with that. And that so that's a pretty good indicator that this is largely affecting that. So let's go look at the generate item test real quick. So if we go into here, we'll see that we have a test right now. And it pulls in generate item. And then from there, what it does is we have a should create a weapon object test, we have an expected weapon. And this is just a pretty normal, like, here's kind of a generic shape. I let's kind of go through the test, actually. So we expect that weapon, which is going to be the result of calling generate item with the config of type weapon and the rarity epic, we want that to match an object. And there's various different ways to do that. Don't worry about that for the purpose of this video. But we're going to say, Okay, I want it to match this expected weapon object. And so it should come back with a type weapon and a rarity epic, which is what we passed in. But it also should have at least a damage and a damage type. And that can be any number or any string. And that's because those are going to be randomly generated. So we can't 100% predict that at this point. If you want to see just really quickly kind of what that looks like, let's do a console dot log of weapon, what that comes back as, I'll come over to here. And we'll just run npm t once. And here you can see this is generally what it comes back. So it's going to say the type is weapon, the damage is piercing damage 19, attack speed zero, is that's not written in yet. And then rarity is epic. So we're kind of in the middle of building this thing, you can think of it that way. So at this point, whether you've written the code yourself, and you're coming back to it a later date, or you're doing it now, or like I said, you're a maintainer, you're kind of wondering, all right, what should I test next? Okay, so what you could do is you could obviously go into your generate item. And if you just wrote this code, you'd probably be able to guess that, well, we generate out a sort of a weapon and an armor, so we probably need to test armor, right. But if you're a maintainer, or you've come back to it from a little bit in the future, it might be a little bit of like mental downloading to kind of get in here and look at all this code and all these functions and be like, Okay, yeah, there's a lot of stuff going on here. And okay, now I start to kind of get you know, what's going on. But you can kind of forego all of that. This is what I really like about coverage is with our coverage report, let's do this. So if you go to the coverage folder, which has been generated for you, when you run the dash dash coverage flag, you can look into this l curve report. And there's going to be an index HTML. Now I'm just going to like reveal this and Explorer as a way to open it. Move that over here. So you can see that. And then I'm just going to open this file. Just that simple. And what's cool is from this point on, I can then reload this anytime I rewrote my code. I wish there was a dark mode for this is blinding me. So we can see that it gives us this nice little diagram sheet. And you can see that source utils is 100% covered. Let's actually just take a quick peek into that. So if you go into source utils, because the helper j s, everything's covered, everything's green and beautiful. And if we look at it, it tells us, oh, this is interesting, like this ran 21 times, somehow, and then 111. And then 2x for this module that exports. Okay, so let's take a look. Why is that? Well, if we go back over to our utils, we have a test for helpers test. And you can see that what it's doing, because it's a randomly generated thing, we are looping over it this 20 ish times, in this case, 21. And we're going to go and call it and we're going to get a random int of three. And we expect that to be greater than or equal to zero. So we know that it's going to start at zero, and then it should be less than three. This is a really nice thing that I like about tests just in general is they can kind of be a sort of documentation if you're getting into a project or reviewing code, because this tells me immediately like, what the qualifications of this function are. In this case, I know that it is exclusive in the upper bound, which means that it needs to be less than three, even though we passed in three. And I know that it probably starts at and is inclusive at zero. So of course, I could figure that out from the code. But it's nice to get a little bit of confirmation. And this test pass after running at 20 or so times. So I've got a reasonable amount of confidence, you could run that as many times as you like. But that's the gist. So back to our report here. Let's now we can see why that lets you know that that test is running out that many times. Let's go back a bit here and look in our trouble area. So if we go to this generate item, we know that we've got some problems here. There's clearly some colors that we don't like typically. And when we're digging into this code, I've got this zoomed in a little bit for you. Normally, it'd be a lot smaller. Let me show you actually, it's like that small. I'll bump this up a tiny bit or a large bit. And as we're looking through, this is actually the code that's being tested by that test file that we ran. And we only had that one test. But you can see it actually covered quite a bit of the code base. And what's covered is just basically the non highlighted sections, you can think of it that way. So it's run through and ran each of these, these one times. And this is where we first want to start whenever you see this little flag. This is an else path not taken, I know that's really tiny, it doesn't zoom that in for you. And what this is trying to tell us is that we know when you run this if condition, you know, some of these else's are not even run. So you're not really testing the full extent of this generate stat function that's in that file. You're only really testing for an epic rarity here. And it does this nice job of also highlighting that here for you. So statement not covered when you hover over that. And yeah, so that's a that's a pretty good just quick flag to say, Alright, well, I know now that our tests don't even cover these examples. So I'm not feeling very confident that this function works to the full extent. Let's keep going down, though. So now we can see that this one generate base armor isn't covered at all, we hover over it, it says function not covered. So that's the functions part of the equation of the stats that come back to us. And it's just going to highlight that return just to show Yeah, you know, even though of course, the function wasn't covered, the statement wasn't covered either. Coming down here, this is a really nice one to get this if path not taken. So this is a sort of short circuit type of command to say like, hey, if you call generate item, and you didn't pass in a type, you know, in this case, they're just going to return null, maybe they return an error, or maybe they turn return, whatever, this is a condition that we really want to test, we don't only want to test was known as like the happy path of, you know, the path to success of a function, we also want to test the ways in which the user might use it incorrectly. And how do we cover that? Do we fail gracefully? Do we throw an error like we intend? And so this is good to, you know, be notified that like, you know, you're not even covering that either, you don't even run a test. This is kind of getting into the meaning of covered. And I'll finish it after I look at this quick line right here. This is just saying same thing else path not taken, we can see that we do check base type item is a weapon. And then you know, that's successful, because we're generating on a weapon. And it runs this line of code. But we don't run this else, which is very clearly at this point for armor. So this sort of leads me into what does covered mean? Because it's very important. Once you're getting into coverage, you can see the benefits right away, I think, as you start to dig into it. But what does it actually really mean? Well, it just means that when they say covered, it means that that code was run in a test. It doesn't mean that you've covered every possible scenario, that you have all of the functionality sufficiently covered, I guess is a better way to word that. So it doesn't really mean that your tests are even good. It just means that the code was run, it's kind of a bare minimum to say, is this even in a test? Does a test even run this code? And because you would get an", "name": "jest-coverage.txt", "vector": [0.001262881327420473, 0.0037728797178715467, 0.007090351544320583, 0.0007378484588116407, -0.01717938855290413,

And you know, if you've never run that in a test, then the test isn't going to fail on a simple error. So that's kind of like the bare minimum version of a test is does the code run and not throw an error, unpredictably, I should say. Why this is important to get into early on is because I think coverage is a super powerful tool. I'm obviously doing a video about it for that reason. But it's also easy to get in the trap of saying, oh, I'm 100% covered, you know, I must be good. But that's not really true. That's like a starting point. That's a really good, you know, goal to get to a really high coverage percentage doesn't have to be 100. It depends on your code base. And you know what the other developers think. But it's just a really good way to start off and say, okay, now my test runs on all of the different code. And now what do I do to make this even more bulletproof? I'll be touching on that here and there as we go through it to kind of elaborate on that definition. But I think you've got enough of that earful. Okay, so now we, as the developers can come in here and oh, I forgot to actually mention, you know, this is a really nice way to show, hey, you know, when we run this, more clues that we need to run armor is that there's this yellow highlight here, this is a conditional highlight. And it says branch not covered. That's how you'll know for conditional logic, that one of the options has not been covered. So the code comes in here, and it runs this type equal to weapon, and it's true. And so it runs this function, but we never run it when it's false. Same thing here. You know, we say, oh, hey, do you have rarity? If you don't, then use common. So we can see that we can see that we always pass in a rarity property when we're calling it. So now we can take a stab at what we need to run next. So let's go over and kind of update one of our tests. So if we go over to the generate item test here, we don't really need this log right here for now. I'm gonna make a new test. And so this will say should create armor object. You know, since we haven't covered that at all. And then in here, I'm just gonna show you that you can actually just run the code. You don't even really have to have a test to get coverage, which is a good and a bad thing, I guess. So we're gonna generate item. And from here, we're gonna do type and we'll set that equal to armor. And then what I'm gonna do is I'm going to set the rarity equal to... Let's do rare. Save that. Go away. Now, let's run test with coverage one more time. Oh, that was just test, huh? test dash dash dash dash coverage. We'll add that into our script pretty soon. Well, you can see our numbers got a lot better there. Okay? So let's go back over to our browser and we're refresh. Now check this out. I'm gonna refresh kind of like, let's say like down here. Let's see what happens. Boom, look at all that. All of that cleared. So just by calling that function, we have run our code in a test against all of this other functionality. We can still see that we have some weak points. We didn't check the don't pass in something. What happens? We got to this interesting branch where we always get zero here. I guess we'll kind of come back to that. And then we come up here and it looks like we ran most of this code too. And notice that some of these are being run two times now because we have these two different tests. And so they're always kind of this is kind of like showing you, hey, what what path is traversed most through your tests? And you can see this kind of makes sense. We generated a rarity epic item and we generated a rarity rare item, rarity rare. And then we did not do the else, which is actually a common. That's the fallback. And that's why when we go down here, you know, we don't have this tested either. Now this is kind of one, this is really cool, but it's also to really emphasize that gotcha here of coverage that notice that I just ran this code. I didn't even do an expector or anything like that. So it's a test that the code, you know, completes successfully and doesn't have an error when you pass it in an armor type. But it doesn't really test that anything useful comes back, right? So let's quickly do that. You know, we'll just copy this and I'll go back up to here and I'm going to copy this expected object as well. And obviously this is not for, you know, learning how to test every single thing here. We're just going over coverage. So we're going to make it path of least resistance. So let's say we got an armor and we expect that to come back as a rare. Let's actually leave that epic so we could see it fail. And then this case, it wouldn't have damage. So we could go over to our report here and be like, okay, what does it give us back? We could look at the code too, of course. Generate base armor. It looks like it gives us back defense and an armor type. So let's say defense and that's going to be a number, an armor type, and that's going to be any string. And if you're curious, that's just right up here. You can see what it does is it, it goes to this sort of const type where we're going to be picking from one of these things randomly when we generate it out. Not super important, just if you're curious to follow along, don't worry about that too much. So now this expected weapon, we're going to change this to expected armor and then generate item armor, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Oh, oops, this right here, we don't want to pass in weapon. We want to pass in, oh, we need to store this armor equals armor. And there we go. So let's do that. So let's test this one more time. And you'll see we got that fail, right? Now notice that the test suite failed. It still printed out our coverage report. We didn't get any sort of coverage fail yet, but we did get this failure. So we know that that's working somewhat as intended. It's really not the most rigorous test yet, but we're getting there. Okay, so that passes. Now the thing is that none of this really should have changed. And so once again, I know I'm beating a horse here, but it's such a strange expression. I know that I'm beating this to death, but we, I just want to go over this last time here that the coverage is not changing even though we wrote a better test. So the coverage led us to say, yes, we need to test this thing, but we need to actually make it a useful test still. Okay, done ranting. So now we, let's like take it one more step further here. Let's say, okay, we know that we're not running this else statement here on rarity. And we also know that we're not running the shortcut here, short circuit, and we're not doing a common, which we would get from passing in no rarity at all. There's also this little thing here. So let's like just do one more pass super fast. So we'll write a test now. And this test is going to say, should default to common item when no rarity passed. Something like that. Okay, that got a little bit long. Sorry, let me see if I can scroll down over here. Oh, the challenges of zoomed in. Okay, so in this case, what did we have here? Well, we could just generate an item with just a type. So let's do, I'll do generate item, and we'll pass it a type equal to weapon. And that's it. Let's test that. Okay. Run our test here. And that's looking better and better, more and more green, we'd love to see that. And there you go. Look, now common is covered. And then we come up here and this is covered. So we're getting closer and closer. You can see we're kind of whittling away at this file and getting a little bit more confidence each time. Now, I'm not going to waste more time by, you know, writing a proper check test on this, because you're kind of getting the point. But let's say, all right, let's say, all right, well, let's do one more here. I want my template here. So let's say that I want to do my short circuit, and then we'll kind of call it good on this file. So I'll say, should return null when no values passed. Or actually, in this case, it was no type passed specifically. And this is, again, nice for us to read, you know, coming into the project is sort of a documentation of like, when does this, what does this function do when pass these things. So we'll generate item. And when we generate that item, let's see what happens if we just pass it nothing at all. Okay, see, that's interesting, because we tried to destructure this property type of undefined. So in this case, the cover just kind of led us to an actual problem with our test, because the person writing this was like, Okay, well, I'll just pull off type by default, yada, yada, yada. And then I'll check the types not there. And that's really the only situation where I want to, you know, catch here. I worded that poorly, but I think you get the point. So let's see what we can do about that. Okay, so if we come back over to our generate item, of course, we could just make it, you know, succeed by passing it or an object that was empty, let's say, but that's not really necessarily what we want. You know, we want to fix things as we go. So to get this passing, let's do something like this. Let's say that I'm going to, you know, cut this out right here. And I'm going to change this to maybe let's say item options. And we're going to by default, use a object, we're going to, you know, fall back to passing in an object if they didn't pass in anything at all. And that will let us do something like this, we'll say pull off type and rarity from item options. There's of course, many ways you could do this. And this is just a quick way to make our code just a little bit more robust here. Because now, we can guarantee that at least type can be pulled off of this empty object as undefined at the very least. So now let's run our test. And you can see that it passes now. If we go back over to our coverage one more time, and we refresh, you can see that this has hit many times, of course. And we now successfully check this scenario, this unhappy path here. So really all that's left, we've covered a lot at this point. And we I feel a lot better about this, I think that anyone doing this should, especially if you're just kind of coming in and looking at some legacy code and building a little test harness around it, we can see that we started off with very low coverage. And now we're covering a lot more situations. Again, we need to write a little bit more robust tests there. But at least we're checking that you know, it doesn't just straight up fail. But what's glaring at us right now is this little bucko right here. And this is something that I just wanted to illustrate really quickly. So if we take a look and hone in on this code, what it's doing is it's saying, okay, this base item that we're kind of creating, I know we haven't gone through the code that much. But this base item at some point is checking, it's going to add the stealth bonus property to it. And you can see that if the armor type is light, you're going to get a three bonus. Otherwise, you're going to get a zero. Now what's interesting about that, though, is this armor type itself, let's actually go back to our code to check this out. So this armor type right here, you can see that we come up here, when we generate base armor, armor type is sort of randomly created from this list up here. And so this is outside of the control for us at this point, because we can just run this test over and over and over. And essentially, you know, one of these times, it's going to switch on us, which is pretty confusing. Let me try to show that real quick. It's actually at a log, though, while we're doing it. So we have this one generate armor case, right? So let's log out armor. So we have an armor that is the light type, which means that you get the bonus of three, right? And so now you can see it flipped here. So flip from three to zero. And just to show you one more time, if I run that again, we got light again. And now we got heavy this time, you're not noticing that's right here. And then when we flip over here, it's going to change every time. So this is kind of something to know here is that like, you know, the coverage, it's a little trickier, or tests in general get trickier when you have randomly generated things. And so at this point, what you would probably want to do is do some sort of mock the method that you're testing, and or you could make it to where you have overrides that you can pass in. So you can get some hard returns, hard coded returns, this is what I mean by that. And this gets a little bit too much into a side rant. But I'll just note that, you know, we're testing generate item only. And, you know, in our tests here, each of these tests is really just calling generate item. But we really, if we're doing unit tests, you know, we should be calling some of these individually to test them, and not relying on our test to kind of go through each of those things. That's what I feel about it. So there's various different ways that you could cover this. I'm just showing that to you. And we're not going to solve that here, because it attracts too much from the main point of the video. But just know, this is something that coverage is a little bit tricky to track, but actually can be really helpful. Because I've had times where if I have some sort of random thing, all of a sudden, you know, my, my test coverage will be lower. And I have some stipulations to fail it. And from that, what will happen is it will reveal to me that my tests aren't actually that good, because they're kind of random, whether they cover something or don't or run one track or another. Okay, so now we've gone through this process of utilizing utilizing coverage to kind of hit to us what to test next. And I think that this is a really good tool if you're newer to testing to kind of introduce you to what you know, what really should I be testing. And like I said, also, it's really nice when you're coming into another code base, and you can get a good idea of how well covered all their code is. So you know, I think it's pretty awesome. Hopefully, you do as well. But let's move on to the next part of coverage where we can make it even more powerful here. And that is to add a config option. Now, what I want to show first for that to kind of reveal that actually, let me remove my log super fast. So I'm not flooded with that. We've used its purposes. And for now, we're going to be done with generate item test for a little bit. When we ran this test, this coverage report here, we noticed that this source utils helper j s was 100% covered here, right? Now, what's interesting about this, there's a couple things. When we go to utils, notice we have this get biggest change file in here, but that's not in our coverage report. Huh? That's interesting. And then if we go to the tests of the helper one, this is", "name": "jest-coverage.txt", "vector": [0.009776327759027481, 0.006303158588707447, 0.004947267007082701, -0.012335139326751232,

This get random int in range is actually being tested by generate item, because generate item imports it, let me go up here and uses it. And so through writing the tests of generate item, you've indirectly tested get random int in range. This is good and bad. I mean, it's great, because you are still testing it in sort of a real use case scenario, but you're not really directly testing. The bigger problem to me, though, is this get biggest change is like not reporting to me that it's not tested. And that's because the default, which I think is a good default for jest and coverage is that it's only going to run without any additional configuration, mind you, it's only going to run against tests that exist. So this helper test j s imports, get random int, and runs it on that. And because of that, because it's importing this file right here, it's going to put that into the coverage report. But get biggest change doesn't have any tests that run it at all directly or indirectly. And so it's just not going to be in our coverage report. And this is nice, because it's an it's a good way to ease yourself into testing. But I want to be a little more strict, I really want to know out of all of my files, what is tested, what is not what is covered what is not. So in order to accomplish this, what we'll do is we'll make a jest dot config dot j s, you could also do this as a jest property in your package JSON, but I think this is the better way to do it personally. And then we'll do module dot exports. You I think this can also be in a JSON file, whichever you prefer. And we're going to start with this property here. And it is going to be collect coverage from and that will be an array. And so what we'll do here is we'll say I want to test against source. And then I'll do star star slash star dot j s. And so what that's going to do for me here is I'm going to say, you know, I want to test anything in my source directory, because that's my actual code. And, you know, maybe I should show you just really quick, let's say, what if we didn't do that source? What if we just did star star dot j s. This is kind of interesting, huh? So notice this jest config dot j s was now tested. And all these different other things in the coverage folder were tested. So that's kind of the point that I'm getting at is that we don't want to test every single thing in our project, because some things are generated, some things are node modules, and things are etc. So what we want to do is go back to this point where we can say anything in my source directory, that's what I've written. Now, so that you know, you can also do something like this, where you say, don't test this, there's a couple different ways to do this, but don't do anything that has node modules in the name, I don't think you actually need to do this, because I think by default, it's going to ignore coverage, the ignore coverage setting is going to have node modules added to it. But they show it a lot in the docs. And so it doesn't really harm anything. So I always throw it in there. Now, this also allows you to ignore, you know, specific files, just so that you know, like if you wanted to ignore, let's say, get biggest change is something that we're not ready to run coverage test at all on right now, well, you could throw that in the ignore, if it's, you know, blocking you from moving forward, for some reason, you'll see why it would be blocking you in just a moment, actually. But so let's run coverage again, now, we should get a much slimmer report. But now look at this, we have added get biggest change to the source utils when before it only had helper JS. And it's telling us that is 0% covered. And look at this global, we used to be so let's go up here a little bit. Look how good we used to look. Great 93.33 branch, that's fine. That's actually pretty good. Then down here, you know, that was that one conditional that we couldn't cover. And now it's so much lower, because this file overall has dropped it. I really like this because it's a good way to kind of it's like a measure of confidence of, you know, of all my files, how well tested are they? Well, if some things are like completely not tested, they're really going to bring down your overall confidence rating in the code base. Now, if we hop back over to our coverage report here, now when we come back here to the root, you'll see that this source utils, which used to be all green, now our source is actually green, but source utils is much more hit up. And if we click on that, you'll see that this is all the stuff that we haven't run any path whatsoever. Now, to speed this up a little bit, I'm going to, you know, toss in a couple of tests right here that I've pre-written just to show you that getting covered a little bit better. So I'm going to make a file real quick here for this in source utils. I'll write a new file and I'll just call it get biggest change dot test dot js. Paste this. So I've got a few test cases already in here now. And so as we can see, when we call them, all we're really doing is we're just saying, hey, call get biggest change with a thousand. In this case, it's copper pieces and the copper pieces are passed in and we say, OK, well, that should be exchanged to one platinum if we want the biggest change version. And then here, you know, you can see you get two platinum and three copper. And finally, here we're testing a big number like 40. So come back over to here, run our coverage again, and we'll see that's looking a little bit better. It's yellow, right? Let's come over here and our coverage report and refresh. We're looking a lot better, right? It's kind of fun. So really, all we need to do is cover, you know, oh, hey, you didn't actually cover any scenarios where you give them back gold or where you give them back silver. And so I'll do that super fast. I'm just going to copy this test here. And I'm going to pass some silly scenarios. So let's say you pass in a hundred or maybe two hundred, doesn't really matter. That should give you some gold, pass in another one. Let's do 70. Should give you seven silver. Run that. Nice, getting better and better. You can see uncovered line is still line 11, which we'll come back to here. Perfect. But this line 11 where we didn't pass anything is the last thing. So let's go back up to the top. And normally I'd write another test just to kind of identify this a little bit better. But I think this is fine for now. So let's pass in nothing. Now, what we should expect to get back is just this object of no coins whatsoever. And oops, go back over here, run it. Ooh, look at all those hundreds. And there you go. Now we have this file fully covered. So let's show how we can make the impact of that a little bit more drastic. Actually, this is where it gets really fun to me. So we've set up a config to where we're making it to where we actually know now like if any code in our source folder whatsoever is not covered. And of course, we could expand that to your project's needs, however you like. But what if, well, actually look at this. We can see that it's the test, regardless of fails or not, we go all the way back up here. When this was terrible, the test still pass, which is good. That's what we want. But we're going to be wanting to add this into some continuous integration in a moment. And to where what the result of that is going to be is every time on GitHub, when a pull request is done into the main branch, for me, I'm going to run a coverage test. And if any tests fail, then you can't merge. And if the coverage falls below a certain threshold, then you can't merge. So let's set the first steps up for that. So in this Jest config, we're going to add on another property here. This property is going to be coverage threshold, not two H's. And that object here is really interesting. It's going to have a global property. This is the kind of the default way to set this up. And the global property here is really neat. What we can do is we can say, what global coverage do we expect to have? Well, we can target each thing. So we'll say for branches, I want 60. Let's say, let's make it really high at first. So we'll say 90. Functions, 90. Lines, I guess we'll do the same thing for all of them for now. Now you may be wondering, like, how would you come up with these values? I'll talk to that in just a second. Let me actually show you the impact of this. So right now when we run it, we should be good because we've covered so many things. But check this out. What if we go back to this get biggest change test file here? And what I'm going to do, I'm going to wipe out all the rest of these tests. So I've commented them all out and it only runs the one. Let's see what happens. Ah, interesting, eh? So now we get these right here where it says global coverage threshold for statements, 90% not met. 70.83 is what you got. And you can see that right here, confirming that. So what does this mean? What does this red text even do? Well, it's obviously alerting us, which is nice, but it's also going to return a sort of error exit code here that when we run it in our, in really any environment, but in particular for us, our continuous integration that we're about to have, it's going to fail when it doesn't meet this criteria and that test will actually fail as a whole. So you're going to get a failure if your tests don't pass, which is obvious, but you're also getting a failure if you don't have proper coverage. And this is to help protect your system or your project as it grows and grows and grows in scale and people continue to add functionality and change functionality and all that stuff. If they're not adding tests as they do that, eventually you'll fall below this threshold and it'll fail you and it'll be like, okay, it's time to write some tests guys. So that leads me back to, you know, what I was saying before is like, okay, well, how do you come up with these numbers that we came up with here? How do you say, you know, what makes you decide 90, 90, 90, 90? It's really based on your preferences. If you have a new code base that you're trying to test slowly and build this test harness over, you know, maybe legacy code base or something, you probably want to start lower and kind of increase the strictness as you go. If it's new, you should probably set it higher so that you're alerted really early. So let's go to another scenario here, actually, where, let me close this over here. We don't need that right now. So actually, what I'm going to do here is I'm going to bring all this back in, get us nice and covered, and I'll show you through a different type of example. So now we're passing. Okay, but let me show you a higher level override that we can do here for this next demo is we started with global, but what we can actually do is target individual folders and files how we like, which is really sweet. So in this case, I'm going to do dot slash source. And here I'll do utils. And so I'm going to say the utils folder is very important to my project because everything's using it. I want very high confidence there. 80, 90, not enough. So what I'll do is I'll just copy all of these lines here to override them. And I'm going to say 100s. Got to be 100 everything for utils. Okay, so we'll come back here. We'll run this. And it's passing right now. So that's fantastic. We're very happy. But let me show you an interesting scenario. And then we're going to push this up, show some continuous integration. So let's say that if you recall earlier, there was this test here for helpers, and we're only testing one of the functions. Well, the other way that we were testing it was in generate item, this get random int in range was used. So what if someone, you know, in the future came in here and was like, you know what, I don't really like using it that way. I want to do get random int only. And that takes well, actually, they could just leave it that way, because it would just not pass in the second argument. So let's do that. And now you can see that we're not using this, right? So what's going to happen here? Well, when we run this, this coverage example, we're going to fail all of a sudden. And that's because we weren't directly testing this. And by this, I mean that that particular helper that we were indirectly testing before, and now we're not. Okay, so let's say someone did that. And now I'm going to create a new branch just to kind of show a normal kind of workflow example. And let's say, let's call it, you know, swap, random int, something silly like that, right? Normally I would review all my, you know, different changes and stuff like that in VS code. But for demo purposes, to speed this up, let's just commit it and say, swap random, what was it get random int in range out, I won't get more specific than that. Okay, so now, we'll push this. We're gonna push this up here. Now I've already gone and set this up, but I will show you kind of what that looks like really briefly. If we go over to here, you'll notice that this is my repo. And of course, GitHub's awesome is going to say, Oh, do you want to you got a new branch that you've pushed up? Do you want to make a pull request? Well, yes, I do. So I'm not going to bother doing anything fancy here, of course, but we'll speed this along. So now what's happening is these checks are running automatically, this is your continuous integration. And you can click this to see some details. Let me open a new one here. And this is really neat. So the testing coverage. I don't know why it took me to that weird screen. We're about to run this. And then we can see that it runs, yada, yada, yada. In this case, it passes. So everything ran, let me let me dig into that just so you can see. Everything passes. And that's because right now, we're not we're just running a, the just CI, but we're not doing our coverage yet. So I want to show you that when we push this up, even though it has failed our coverage, it's just passing the test. And that's all we required in order to merge. So if we go back over here, we'll see Yeah, we're good. So let me show you that real quick by switching it. If I come back to here to my code, and what I'll do is in the package JSON, I'm going to add a dash dash coverage flag here now to the test CI. So you don't have to really worry about this flag. It's mostly just for snapshots, the way that they run in CI to be a little bit more efficient. It's pretty standard for jest. And then the dash dash coverage here, obviously, is now we're going to be like, okay, well, I actually care about coverage as well. So let's add that.

"Check that, push it up. And let's see what happens. So this is the this is that one run. So we need to back out of that. We'll see that this has started up again. We'll kick on over to this. See it runs checkout code diving into this part right here, just follow it along. Error. It's kind of cool, though, you could see it did actually print out our little table here of all that stuff with the coverage and it gave us these comments and why it wasn't met. But eventually, we got this is what I was talking about before this exit code one. So when you get that, it's actually going to fail this step entirely. Notice now we have this red X, all checks have failed. So in my case, for my repo, and this is pretty common for any public repo, the administrator can override that if they want to. But even if you go to, it's really nice, it's going to make you check this box. It's like, you're really sure about that. So cancel that here. And actually, if you want to see, I probably should be covering this a lot more in a CI particular video, but I'm sure some people will be curious. So I'll just briefly show you. If you pop on over to your your settings in your repo, this has to be a public one to do this. You have to pay for specific, you know, access to bit bumped up. But you go to branches, right here, you can see that there's this branch protection rules here. And if I go to edit, all I'm doing here is I named the branch main. And I'm saying I require these status checks to pass before merging test and coverage, because normally it'll still show up in the CI like so it'll fail here, but it won't require it to pass to merge. People just kind of be like, hey, just so you know, this failed, you know, you could still merge willy nilly. So this nice little branch protection rule is saying like, people can't even merge without admin access to this branch if any checks fail. That's how serious you want to be about it. Okay, so let's fix it real quick. So we'll go over to here again. And back to our files. And so we have this helpers test. So really what we want here, this this is kind of cool, because the coverage has sort of shown a vulnerability in the way that we're writing our tests. And that's that we're indirectly testing through generate item, one of these helpers. And we we can now be like, well, you know, I don't necessarily want to change the code base of generate item to use this anymore. You know, really, we delete this, of course, and we're just not going to use it maybe for now. Maybe you use it somewhere else, who knows. But for this to not happen again, and for someone to know that they can confidently use this method in the future, we should probably write a test specifically for it. So that test is going to look, you know, something like this. Pretty much the same thing. But you know, we'll call it between four and nine, we'll say that it should equal or be greater than four and should be less than nine. We'll run that. And this is what's really nice about CI is a lot of times you'll forget. In this case, we could actually just run npm run test on CI, since we have that script now. We got an issue here. Ah, yes, we're calling the wrong function. Well, that's always nice to get right. So we actually need to say import int in range, int in range. Good to know that that can fail, right? That's the nice thing about testing. And there you go. We could run it again and again if we want, but there we go. So what I was kind of saying was that what's nice about CI or continuous integration in this case, for this context, is that, you know, people are not going to remember to write to run the tests every single time they change code. They're just not. So this is a way to sort of enforce that. You could do it on the push level, every single push. In my case, it's been sufficient for me to say, look, you can't merge into the main branch until you pass these tests. So maybe you would do that on feature branches into any merges. It kind of depends on how complex your project is. So with that, now we'll show the passing pipeline. So let's say added, add test. Proper grammar here for commits. Add test for get random int in range. I don't know why I care about these messages. It's just an example. So we'll push that up. And because we have this PR open, it's automatically going to rerun. Sometimes this doesn't update right away, so you just refresh. That took a while. It took a couple of refreshes there. So here's our old failed one. I'll just leave that open. Now we can go over to here. These are pretty quick, usually. If you've got a lot of stuff going on, it can take longer. And there you go. And look, this was automatically swapped back. And now we can successfully merge this into our code base. I can click that. I can say confirm merge. There you go. It's really neat that you get to see the history here too. It's like, oh yeah, at one point this failed and then all your checks succeeded. Now if you're wondering how that works in particular, like I said, I'll probably be doing a continuous integration video. If you guys want that and want to see more of the ways that you can do that in your project, just let me know in the comments or on Twitter or whatever that you want to see more of that stuff. But just so you can kind of get a quick peek here, if you have this.github workflows, obviously this is on GitHub. It's different from Bitbucket or GitLab, but you have this folder structure and you can look it up on GitHub actions. I just have this test.yaml file and I'm saying on pull request on these branches. So any pull request to main, I want you to run this test coverage. And here's just the name of it. You don't need to worry about running on Ubuntu latest, checking out the code. It's a pretty standard step, but this is the part that we care about. We run npm ci, which is sort of npm install, but on the ci, a little bit leaner, and then npm run test ci. And it's that simple. So I'm just telling it to, you know, install my packages and then run this command that I have. And just with that little bit of setup, we have some really awesome configuration to protect us and protect our code base and let us know what's going on and let us know when people change features. You know, what's really sweet about that is in that scenario that I just showed with generate item where I swapped out this value, this could be a PR that someone's making to my code base, whether it's open source, whether it's on a team. And I wouldn't have to dig through and find that that thing wasn't used or is used differently. I would immediately know from that test failing that, oh, we actually don't have any tests that actually test this helper out anymore. And we were relying on that. So it's really awesome way to automate and keep yourself informed and keep the confidence in your project high. So that was a lot. But if you've made it through all that, hopefully you're wiser for it. I think I've spoken to the benefits of the coverage, utility function and coverage reports in general enough that I don't need to re go over them again here. I hope that was fun and interesting for everyone who stuck it through that. And I encourage all of you to try it out in your own projects and see how it, you know, makes you feel better about your code and what things you discover. I've learned a lot by using just coverage and tests in general about the soundness of my code. And that's why I'm a big believer of testing and unit tests and all the types of tests in general now. And with that, I will say goodbye and hopefully see you in the next video.", "name": "jest-coverage.txt", "vector": [-0.0010525417746976018, 0.0012839456321671605, 0.013967118225991726,

Swashbuckling with Code. I'm Jimmy Cleveland and in this video I want to talk to you about why I think the vast majority of you should not be learning Webpack in 2023 and what some battle-tested alternatives are that you should be looking into and that I'm going to be doing some videos on shortly as well. This is kind of a funny video for me to do because my Webpack series has actually consistently remained my most watched videos. And while I think that having some Webpack knowledge can really help your fundamentals in this world of bundling and transpiling and all that good JS stuff, I just don't think it's worth it for most developers with all the great alternatives out there now. Why I say most developers though when I say you shouldn't be learning Webpack in 2023 is because Webpack still remains a very flexible and customizable tool and there's a lot of frameworks and tooling out there that's built on it because of that flexibility. And you might also be in a work environment where your company is using Webpack or an older application that you're using is built on Webpack and you don't have the bandwidth to transfer it over to something newer. There's just a few niche scenarios where Webpack might make sense for you. But if you're starting a newer project now or you're just newer to web development in general and you're trying to get your head around all this transpiling, bundling nonsense, I just think there's some really nice lean tools, super fast, work pretty much out of the box that you can just dive into and get going. Because in the end you should just be making apps, right? So enough preamble, let's just dive into the build tools that I think that you should be learning in 2023. And that's build tools, plural, because you can just learn one of these, but I'm going to give you a few options for various different scenarios or personal preferences of developers that I think should cover the vast majority of use cases. And I'm going to have timestamps for each of these. So if you just want to look at one in particular and then bounce, that's totally cool. And keep in mind that I am going to be making some videos that get into some more depth on how to actually use these instead of just covering the highlights of what they have and what they offer. So if you're into that, you know, subscribe, hit the notification bell, whatever, you know, you do you. Okay, so as to not waste any more of your time, I'm going to start with the best one, the one that I think that most of you should be looking into, and that is Vite. Now I actually feel like this might be the favorite right now. But that just might be my social circles. And the main reasons are that it's super fast, it just works right out of the box. And you'll actually notice that quite a few of the tools in the ecosystem are starting to be built on this, including Astro if you're familiar with that. So what's really great about Vite is their documentation just really modern and fresh. And it just focuses on getting you going right at the beginning. And I love that you can dig into more details if you want to about their methodology and why they do the things they do. And that's also awesome. They give you some simple commands that you can run like npm create Vite, or you can use yarn or pnpm or whatever you name your app, and then you can provide a template or you could just leave that off. And then the CLI is going to walk you through this sort of wizard experience of asking you what JavaScript framework you want. They support vanilla JS, React, Vue, Svelte, all the good ones. And when you select each one, they also have a TypeScript option for each. And it's really cool. Once you hit it, it sets up your project with a little boilerplate. A quick note about the TypeScript though, that Vite uses, they do use ES build under the hood in development to transpile TypeScript, which actually doesn't do type checking on each build because it's way faster not to. And this is okay for a lot of you because your IDE is probably going to let you know about most of the TS errors. But if you want that actual type checking on your build process, you're going to have to set that up yourself in your own build process, or your CI or whatever you want to do with that. Just know that one of the interesting things about Vite that makes the developer experience so fast is that they don't actually bundle all of your code. Each time you make a save or change, they use native ES modules with hot module replacement for a faster cycle time. So you could of course just set up your own project with just native ES modules and import them into the browser and that'd be fine. But Vite adds some really cool tooling on top of that, including the hot module replacement. And if you're not familiar with that term, you might be familiar with hot reloading. And it's similar except it doesn't reload the page, it actually just kind of ejects the module so that when you save if you're like in the middle of filling out a form, and then you change something, the form will still be filled out, it doesn't actually fully refresh the page, it'll do the same thing with CSS, where you don't have to keep refreshing and get to your current state, it's just a lot faster development time. Now I mentioned that it uses ES build under the hood for development time to improve page load speed. But Vite also uses rollup under the hood for production builds. And that's really interesting. The reason they do that is because ES build actually is lacking in some functionality for code splitting, CSS splitting, such like that, which means that if you use ES build for the production build, your apps aren't going to be quite as performant in some situations as they would be if you use a real powerful tool like rollup that's just built with that feature set in mind tree shaking code splitting to the maximum all that good stuff. If you aren't familiar with all those terms, that's perfectly fine. You're probably going to pick them up as you go. Or you can check out my future videos, I'm going to be referencing them as I dig into each one. But it essentially really just equates to a better performant experience for your users when you're building apps. Another quick little cool thing about using rollup under the hood for production builds is that it can lean on the plugin ecosystem of rollup, which is super mature. And that means that if there's something that you can't customize with Vite, which is pretty well customizable, honestly, there's a bunch of rollup plugins that have kind of been ported over modified. So they work well with Vite, there's a whole list of them. And you can just grab one of those and do it pretty similar to a rollup config. Now I did mention that Vite uses ES modules, which some browsers, some legacy browsers might not support, well, they actually have an official plugin that they support in order to use it with legacy browsers, which sounds pretty cool. But I have never tried that. So I can't vouch for it. But it's there if you want to check it out. One of my favorite things about Vite that you get right out of the box is it's very similar to Parcel if you've ever used it where if you just provide a certain file type that it can handle or a certain configuration file, it's just going to automatically detect that without any setup required from you. So for example, if you add a post CSS config, it's just going to work. If you want sass or less or stylus or any of those, you do have to install the packages. But once you do and create the sass file, for example, you could just import that in your regular JavaScript code, and it's just going to load up and work just right. They've also got CSS module support built in, which I like to use whenever I'm kind of building something really lean. And they've also got great image support, static assets, SVGs, all that type of stuff, you just import them and it does all the work for you of turning it into a hash and your final bundle. You know, every time the file changes or whatever, you just import it and it'll make all connect all the dots for you, so to speak. And all of that comes pre-configured for you as soon as you pick the template for the framework that you want. So in summary, I think that Vite is probably the number one choice this year for the build tool that I think you should start with if you're looking to just quickly create a project and get going and have awesome fast cycle time. All right, if you're still here after that one, my next pick is going to be ES build. And why would you pick this over Vite? Well, particularly, I think that you should first start off knowing that Vite does use ES build under the hood for development at least. And that's what makes it so freaking fast. But if you want to use ES build itself, what you're going to get out of that is kind of some lower level customization and leaner toolset. So if you're the type of developer that wants it as minimal as possible, and you don't mind doing a little bit of extra work to set some things up, this might be the tool for you. So with ES build, when you're starting out, you can just run an NPX ES build commander the like, and you give it your in file and your out file. And it's just going to bundle that up for you with some defaults and essentially have something that you can load up in an HTML file and it'll work. There is a configuration option built in, but it's a little bit weird. I would say that's one of the weird things about ES build is it doesn't feel quite as idiomatic for lack of better term, as normal in the JS ecosystem. It's just not very typical to how most JS build tools work. So you might just have to get used to that. But it is pretty simple to get an app up and running. And it's really fast. It's written with go under the hood. And that's the main reason for the speed, of course. But some of the downsides to ES builder doesn't come with a dev server or anything like that. You have to create your own HTML file and all that good stuff. It doesn't come with any of that out of the box like Vite would. It also seems to be pretty focused on either vanilla JavaScript or react with JSX. Most of the docs are covering only that I know that there are some plugins out there for view and spelt and such. And of course, Vite uses it under the hood. But this is another thing you want to know going in. Even if you're not really interested in ES build as a main tool, it might be worth just going through the getting started documentation. It's only going to take you 1520 minutes probably to get a react app up and running with pretty much no configuration. It's pretty awesome. You just create your standard react, react DOM or server client file, your index file, then you're going to make like an app file. In this example, I'm doing one from the react docs that just has a little counter and it's just going to automatically detect the JSX and set that all up for you and output the bundle correctly. Then you just create your own HTML file, you throw a little script tag pointing to that and bada bing bada boom, you've got a react app up and running. I think if you're making just a really simple app, this is a pretty good tool to have in your belt. But if you do need a lot of customization, be prepared to dig into the docs and really learn some stuff. Because personally, for me, it just wasn't the most intuitive tool to learn for quite a bit of use cases. Now I have to finalize with this point because it's going to segue into my next one. One problem that I really have with ES build is it doesn't seem very well built for libraries, even though they do mention that I'm someone who spent a lot of time on build tooling. So I wouldn't say that I'm like an expert, you know, it's not like I've built these tools myself. But if I'm struggling to make code splitting work out of the box on different routes on next JS, for example, just trying to drop my library that I created in ES build into it like I would any other package. Well, if I'm struggling with all that, then probably a lot of developers are going to, I feel like a lot of people think they're getting all those proper benefits out of the box with the s build and actually aren't. So really just do some testing. One of the tests that I do is when I make a package with it, you know, let's say I'll publish it or use relative installs or whatever. But let's say you publish a package, then I'll just spin up a brand new next JS server, for example, since it's a really popular tool. So of course, your library should work for it if it's a react library, and I'll install it. And then what I'll do is I'll import one module on one page and one module on another. And I'll see if that code actually got split between the two. So it only loads on the page that it's used. And then there's something that just did not work with a lot of configuration options from me using ES build. But if you're not doing any of that, and you're not worried about creating a library package for other people to use, or you just don't really need that much code splitting or whatever you just it's pretty lean, and I think he has built a pretty awesome tool. All right, now here's my third alternative that I think is one of the major build tools you should consider in 2023. And this one, particularly if you are creating a JavaScript library, that build tool is roll up real quick note before I dig into roll up, I should probably explain the difference between an app and the library briefly, those are the two main terms that you're going to run into. And an app is essentially what it sounds like it's like a website or an application that you're using JavaScript to create and host and you know, running the client or server side render or all those good things. But a library is different because that's something you're intending to be reused by other apps or websites or other users. Okay, those are very different concerns. Now you definitely can create apps in roll up, and people do. But for me, it's not the tool I would reach for. I think where it really shines is libraries. This is the only tool that I can consistently get maximum performance out of my libraries. I mean, all of the tree shaking code splitting goodness that you're looking for. I do a lot of design system work over the last few years. And so roll up is a really handy tool in my tool belt, because it's the only one that I can get all of the optimal performance out of of all the tools that I've tried it. It's the one that handles the the full optimal tree shaking, which isn't so hard. Most of the other ones have figured that out, but mostly the code splitting.

look at roll up. Now be warned that roll up is much like a web pack, and that it is a beast, it takes a bit to learn, I would say it's one of the least intuitive ones to pick up and just get going. I do plan on making a roll up video in the near future, especially if there's some interest. So leave me some comments if you are into that. And if you're eagerly awaiting it, of course, you can subscribe and hit the notification bell and all that goodness if that's your thing. But there is a lot to cover with that video. And I want to make sure that I do a good job of it to kind of give you a peek into what you'd be getting into with roll up for your standard TypeScript react setup, you're just going to need to install a few packages, create a roll up config file that utilizes those packages, they cover some of these pretty well in the docs, but some of them you need to go to the individual packages to figure out. Like I said, you kind of have to piece this knowledge together by looking at general tutorials or how other packages are built. I do really wish that the docs kind of gave you more templates are more informative about that. But once you get those basic things set up, you just run your roll up command with a dash C to point to the config and you're off to the races. What's really awesome about roll up though, is that the plugin ecosystem is immense. Turns out there are a lot of challenges to tackle in this modern JS ecosystem. Even just for react, there needs to be like common JS plugins in order to take it from that and turn it into ESM so that you can have all your tree shaking code splitting goodness. There's a bunch of other stuff we won't get into it right now. That'll be in the future video. But just know there's probably a tool out there for most of your use cases. Now those are the three main build tools that I would pick at start with and use as my everyday drivers, each with its own specific type of project that it excels at. If you aren't sure what to choose, I really recommend just starting with Vite. I think you're going to continue to see it just keep growing and growing in popularity. It's really been slicing through those turbulent waters recently and emerging on top. But those build tools are not the only game in town. Those are just the ones that I use that I like and that I can recommend. Some other honorable mentions are Parcel 2, Roam, SWC, and even TurboPack, which the Vercel team is working on and is super promising replacement for Webpack coming up. In the end, just pick one. Don't worry about decision paralysis. Just get going and build things though. That's my advice to you. The competition is great and you should embrace it because while it can be a little bit overwhelming to constantly have new build tools flying here and there, the whole ecosystem is just getting better and better from all that competition. But really just try Vite out. You're probably going to love it. My final note on this video is that you might not even need to mess around or learn any of those tools. Honestly, the major app building frameworks out there like Remix, Next.js, SvelteKit, and Astro growing a lot in popularity recently. All of those things take care of a lot of the stuff for you. You probably won't even need to think about the things that you used to have to with a Webpack configuration. Again, there are times when you have a very specific customization in mind and you might need to learn a little bit of it. And so having those Webpack chops from back in the day, or if you've gone through any of my tutorials recently, those will help in those situations and you'll still have a better fundamental understanding from learning those things about how this whole ecosystem works, of course, with bundling and everything. So really the bottom line for me is just pick one of those tools that's the least amount of friction and just get going building things. All right, as usual, I'm going to wrap this up saying I hope that this information was helpful to you. And I hope that you'll let me know if there's anything I can do to make these videos even better and even more helpful. Hopefully I'll see you all in the next one.", "name": "no-webpack-2023.txt", "vector": [0.006318388506770134, 0.003174119396135211, 0.015363136306405067, -0.026162439957261086, -0.012391338124871254,

Jimmy Cleveland, and today's video is going to be on the topic of semantic versioning, also known as semver. There are many systems that use semantic versioning, such as Ruby since 2.1 and it's a standard for RubyGems if you're familiar with that, but in this video I'm going to be covering it under the lens of NPM. But if you're not familiar with Node or NPM, I still think following along will be useful because the main concepts that I cover are all the same throughout all semantic versioning systems. Now NPM actually has a quick introduction video to semantic versioning, and I'll link that in the notification description, so if you want to check that out, feel free. What I'm trying to do is a little bit different. I'm going to go into a little bit more depth, and hopefully you'll walk away with a really sound understanding of semantic versioning, and I'm going to be doing that in what I hope is a practical example by using two major packages in the NPM repository, Inquirer and Chalk. Hopefully this will give you a real world example of encountering situations where you want to update your package and how you might troubleshoot that or how you go about doing that. So with that out of the way, let's get into semantic versioning. Now I have some timestamps at the bottom of this video in case you want to jump ahead to the actual code segment. This first segment is going to be me talking about what semantic versioning is and why you should learn it and kind of why it came about. Then I'm going to go into some actual code projects and we're going to show examples of installing different versions of packages, what all the different symbols and numbers mean and all that. And that'll wrap up the second part of the video. So a common question that comes up with semantic versioning is why? The short answer of that is without some sort of specific versioning spec in place or a system that everyone complies to when they make packages that they're going to distribute and for people to install, there's just going to be chaos and unreliability. Semantic versioning gives package maintainers and creators a way to communicate what is in each change that they put out. Some high level examples of that are going to be, does this version update include a bug fix that I am safe to update to without changing my code at all, even if I don't even have the bug? Does the new update have a feature that I may or may not use, but won't affect the existing features? Or is it such a major change of the code base that previous users of the package are going to have to change their code, otherwise they're going to risk things breaking when they use it? These are the major points that a semantic versioning system is trying to address. Whenever you roll out a package, there's three numbers and no more, no less. The numbers are major dot minor dot patch. So a common example of that will be 7.2.0, in which seven is the major version, two is the minor version, and zero is the patch version. If a new bug fix came out, the patch version is the first thing to go up because it's just a bug fix and it's just going to fix some previous existing bug that you don't have to do anything about. You just install the package and it'll fix it for you. So that would be 7.2.1 in this example. Then maybe there's a new feature that you might want to access. That would be 7.3.0, for example, for the next bump. Even if it has multiple new features, it'll still be the next number up for the second position, which is the minor one. Finally there's the major version, and that's called a breaking change when that updates. So this is the case would be 8.0.0 if any breaking change would exist in the code base. So sometimes a new feature comes along with a breaking change. And so that's where you'd have to jump from 7.3.0 to 8.0. Because even though you're putting out a new feature, it breaks the code. So when you see a move from just a minor number, just to be clear, 7.2.0 for example, to 7.3.0, well that 2 to 3 in the middle position is saying this is a new feature for you, but it doesn't have any breaking changes that we know about. You can opt into the feature if you want, but you don't have to change your existing code at all to run this package. I really think that learning how semantic versioning works will make you a better coder if the concepts are foreign to you at all. Because it helps you think about your code in a way that you can distribute it to users without breaking their functionality. It really kind of opens up a new way of thinking if you're new to this concept. Where you think, okay I shouldn't just change whatever I want to add a new feature or to fix a bug regardless if other people are going to use this. I should really selectively think about when people use this, how's it going to affect their code? If they do it in such a way that they can just install it and it fixes their bugs and they don't have to do anything at all, then I should probably opt for that path. It's a sort of like least resistance here where you want to start with a bug fix. If you have a minor, okay cool. You have a new feature that you want to show them. And then kind of as a last resort should you do a breaking change. You want to try to keep those to a minimum as much as possible because they're scary for people that are updating packages. One more quick point on this is that if you do have some new way of doing your code that normally would cause a breaking change, you can actually still make that a minor by including the old behavior and then putting a new way to handle the new feature such as a new value in an option config object or something like that. Then you can flag that as deprecated which means that it's not favorable to use that because we're going to be removing it in the future but it won't break it right now. And then you can slowly migrate users away from that old behavior so you can get rid of that part in your code base. So you can kind of see how thinking in semantic versions really helps you write more robust, reliable, and communicative code. To sum up all those points, semantic versioning promotes thinking about your users rather than yourself. Now a downside to semantic versioning is that it doesn't tell you how much code has changed or even how much code you'll have to change if you're the consumer of the package updating it. There are definitely those that have drawn criticism to semantic versioning because of that but regardless it's still a widely adopted system and I don't know of any better ones that are being used in mainstream products currently. But I thought that you'd like to know that it's not new unanimous. There are critiques about it of course as with anything in software engineering. So the last point that I want to hit on before I jump into the code and show the practical examples is these special little characters that you might see. One is the caret or sort of an upward chevron if you can call it that and the other one is a tilled character which is a little squiggly. Whenever you see that the most common default is that caret character in the front of your number so you'd see the caret 7.2.0 for example. What that's saying and this is the default in npm is that when you install that package if it ever updates for any reason whether it's through like some sort of npm update or you run npm install or you don't have a lock file or whatever there's various ways that this can happen it will never bump past that major version because that's a breaking change and so that could be dangerous to your code and that's why it's the default. So that's why you'll see that there. If you were to leave that off and you ever see a package installed with just 7.2.0 no character in front of it that's saying this exact version never update it it's only going to be this one. Now the other one that you'll see which is a little less common is the tilled character and what that is saying is that we're going to be a little more restrictive instead of updating a patch or a minor we're only going to allow updates of patches or bug fixes. So I don't even want new features maybe I don't want to risk it or whatever I only want bug fixes. That's definitely not as common but you will see that from time to time. There's a lot of other nuances of course to semantic versioning as with most things but I'm really trying to hit the major points so that you understand the big picture and so I think it's a good time to jump into the code and hammer that point home with some practical examples. For this first example I'm going to walk through making a quick project setup just so you know everything that's going on but we're going to do it pretty quickly so don't worry. So we're going to first do create a directory and I'm going to name it semver example we're going to cd into that example and then we're going to do is npm init dash y. It's just to say yes to everything. Now one thing that I want to do here is install this package called inquirer. Now inquirer is a really popular package it is used to create CLI command prompts to where you can in the terminal give a user questions and they can answer it and then you can get feedback and act on that program. It's a really really powerful tool and you're going to see it in action in just a moment. It's just a brief introduction. Now normally you would install a package by just typing the name and that's good right but what we're going to do is we're actually use the at symbol and pick a specific version in this case I'm going to pick 7.2.0 so that is major for the seven minor for the two and patch for the zero. Now I'm going to have an example of each of these so don't worry about that as we walk through this just to reiterate that's what it is major minor patch. That's the thing that you want to ingrain in your brain. So I'm going to install that real quick and then I'll show you it in action. Now if I jump over here to my browser I have npmjs opened up here and you can see that this is a very popular package 21 million and I've selected it for that reason because it's such a common package that it's a real world example that's commonly used and you'll be able to do this yourself and follow along and I've imagined for the foreseeable future that's not going to change. So hopefully that makes it pretty practical. Let's jump back over here and let's open our editor. Now in this we're going to have a package json and the thing about that that's interesting is even though we installed 7.2.0 you'll notice that it did that but it put this little caret and what this is saying is that whenever you do an install or an update it will never go past the major version because that's breaking changes but it will go past the minor and patch. So if you look at package lock json and this will be really similar to yarn lock we can actually do a quick search for this package we'll do inquirer and you'll notice that with inquirer here under node modules if you're using a older version of npm it might be a little bit different format here but this is pretty similar. So it says we have 7.2.0 installed so that's the actual version installed. I'll show an example where that's not the case but for now we'll just keep moving on with this example. You'll notice that it also has these dependencies so it has its own dependencies and they'll have their own dependencies and that's how the whole thing works so it's snapshotting each of these versions and you'll notice that they're all using this really common default where it's saying hey I won't go above a major because that's a breaking change but I will auto update minors and patches. So if the first time that you install this you can see this is an exact version actually because it doesn't have a little character the first time you install this let's say that Lodash it had a lower version of Lodash but there's a newer one out that is still four it'll actually update to the newer one. So package locks are kind of their own beast and I can't really cover that in this video it's a little bit out of the scope of this if you really want me to I do have an older video that I'll link in the notification that kind of covers package lock a little bit but if you want me to recover it or refresh it and do some new stuff just let me know in the comments if you're really interested in that. So going back to this, this is one way that we can look up our version, but we can also do a really cool command here where we can do npm ls and that will actually list out all of our packages that we've manually installed, not their dependencies unless you use a flag. Let me show you that real quick. If you do dash dash depth, you can do equals and you can pick the depth. So in this case, with depth of one, we'll show all of the immediate dependencies. And if we were to do depth of two, it kind of gets a little crazy and so on and so forth, dependencies of dependencies and all that. So let's go back up to the root one. Now, if you do npm ls, you can see that and it's going to list out the actual version that you have installed, not the one that you picked. Okay, sometimes that's confusing to people. And why it would differ is depending on if you use the care or the tilt, which we're going to get into. But for now, you can also just really quick. So you know, there's an alias npm list. If that makes it a little bit easier. You can also do this, though, you can do npm view, which is really interesting. And if you pick a package, you can do inquirer. And this is one that's like, let's say it's not even installed, I'll show you that it will list out a lot of interesting stuff about it. So you'll notice that when we do this, it says inquire 812, that's typically going to be the most current version. So we're all the way back on 720. Right now, it'll give you some keywords. And it will also like give you some information here. I don't think I should go over that right now. But the important part is that it will list out the dependencies, which is really useful. And the lovely maintainers who keep this project going, of course, thank you to all of them. And then finally, it'll have a tag. And this is where at latest will come into play a little bit later on. So keep that in mind for now. So jumping back to our example, that's how you can view a package and kind of see what the latest version is and all that stuff. What I'm going to do is go into here and our project and do index dot j s just to create a quick little entry point. So to save some time here, I'm going to paste in some code that I've already done. And I'm going to walk you through it really briefly. But if you've never used inquire before, we're just going to import it", "name": "semver.txt", "vector": [0.019187023863196373, 0.017630575224757195, 0.0192145723849535, 0.0004108492285013199,

-0.029558761045336723]}, {"content": "here. And of course, this is a require syntax and not import syntax, because I'm just trying to make it simple for this current version of node. We you could do it the other way, if you want, we have an inquire, we have a prompt command that you're going to chain onto it. And essentially, what that's going to do is prompt the user for something, you're going to pass it this like array of objects of all the things to prompt them in order. And there's a different way to do it, but we're gonna stick to this one. And then the highlights are that you have the type of prompt that's going to be displayed as you have the name of it, which you're just going to use to keep track of it, the message that you'll show to the user, which you'll see in a moment, and then the choices, which can be a few things, we're going to do an array of strings. So I'm asking them to choose their character class. And then I'm going to give them this list of options. And then after that, I'm going to give them a checkbox version to choose exactly two proficiencies. Okay. And then finally, at the end, it's a promise. So you can chain onto it, don't worry about this for now. And you can log out the answers and you can catch an error. Okay, if you don't quite follow all that, that's perfectly fine. You'll see an example, I just thought you might want to know kind of a little bit about what's going on. So what we'll do is we'll do node index dot j s to run the program. And you'll see that the program has a nice little prompt for that little bit of code, which is really cool. And we can kind of arrow down through this. And what I want you to pay attention to is that it's looping through all the list. And so this is pretty cool right off the bat. Well, let me get into that in a moment. Actually, let's just pick the options now. So I picked Druid. And then right now, I can pick, you know, one option and press enter. And it'll wait a couple of seconds in the code. That's what I've programmed. And then it's going to say, please choose exactly two proficiencies. And so I'll do sure I'll do two of them. I'll just show you that if I do three, it'll still won't allow that. There you go. So go back to that takes a couple seconds, and then it prints it out. It's a really, really simple program, you could do whatever you want from there. But that's not the purpose of this video. What is the purpose is semantic versioning. So remember how I mentioned that that program loops, let's run it one more time and see that. So the program loops through and if someone's not really familiar with this, it might be confusing, you might be going through and being like, wait, did that loop? Did I already see this one? Sometimes it's kind of nice in some programs to the list to just end. So we've been wanting this for a while. And then through a blog or a friend or however, you figure this out, we learned that inquire has a new feature, where you can pass a special little property that makes the loop the list not loop, that was hard to say. Now, let me show you that in their docs real quick. So if you go to inquire right now, this is the latest version, which is ahead of where we're at. But if you type loop, you'll see that there is this loop option. So this is current, but let's go back in time for just a moment here. If you go over to the repository, and click this. And what's cool about this is there is a releases section in GitHub. And this is up to the maintainer to, you know, keep this updated with information or whatever. But a lot of the big projects will have something like that. So this is the current version, let's scroll down and go to the next a couple of times to go back to back in time to where we are, pretend that we're in current time. And seven to was the latest. Here we are at seven to oh, and then all of a sudden, let's go back one. And there's a seven three, oh, out now remember, that's a minor, the three, and they have a new loop Boolean for list types. This prevents the list from looping when reaching the top or bottom of the selection. That sounds pretty interesting. So let's upgrade to that. So if we go to our terminal, I can do npm i inquirer. And I could do at and then I'll say that example exactly. So seven three, oh, we did seven to oh, before. Another way that you could do it just so you know, is you could go into your package JSON. And you could like manually change this to a specific version. But I usually prefer to use the command line. I think it just does a little bit better job. That's up to you. You can play around with however you like. Sometimes the versions are a little bit finicky and how they work. But once you mess around with them a little bit, you'll get the gist of it. So I'm gonna install seven three. Oh, and just so you know, as a quick little hint, remember how when I installed seven three, oh, it automatically did this little up carrot that says it'll upgrade to whatever version. As long as it's not a breaking change, you can actually do dash dash save exact. As a flag, and check this out, when I go back over to here, it did not put that. So if you really want to stick to one version, I usually don't recommend that. But there are times when you do want to do that, then that's how you would accomplish that through the command line. Let's undo that. Let's just do this. If we do npm ls, just as kind of a habit, you could see that that's the version that was installed. So now we can go back into our code. And we can add this little flag here because we got a new feature. And we'll say, list, no loop. Nice. False. I'm gonna do the same on both. False. And then what we'll do now that we've done that is let's just try to run the program and see if it worked. So if I press up, it doesn't go up, which is good before it would. But now if I press down, oh, that's interesting, isn't it? It gets to the very bottom. But it still shows the rest of the list, which I guess is okay. You know, it doesn't let them move on. But I feel like it's still a little bit confusing, right? So we'll say, all right, feature works as intended. Let's check this next one out. What happens here? Oh, this one just like keeps looping. So it didn't even work for the checkbox type. Let's pick our to, you know, close our program. So what's interesting about this is, whether this is real time or not, what's kind of going on here is they have implemented this, but they have a bug in it. Okay. And this is super common. So if they have a bug, and they want to fix it, but it's going to fix an existing feature, but not create a new feature, what should they do? What do you do? should be the version? Well, that's where a patch comes in, right? If we go over here to the previous step, this is going, you know, ahead in the future, we have a 731 and a 732. And you'll look at the 731. For now, it says fix the loop false option in the list prompt. Okay, so here's what we could do. This is where I'll show you the patch only version of installing something which is kind of interesting. We can go over to here and we can see that we've got a patch. And we can see that this is the patch that's going to fix the loop. So what I'll do is I'll go to the patch and I'll do a patch on the loop. So I'll do a patch on the loop. And I'll say, okay, I'm going to go to the patch. And I'll say, okay, I need a patch on the loop. And I'll say, okay, I need a patch on the loop. And I'll go back and install this program once again, and just install this patch just to see. Now we install the patch, and then we'll run the code again. And we can't go up. So that's still working fine. But when we get to the bottom of the list, look, it doesn't show the rest of the stuff. So that's a an effective patch, it actually fixed it like that. And then if we come back to here, oh, no, it didn't actually work for this, you know, they only fixed it for the one thing, unfortunately. Well, let's go back to that, because we did see that there was another patch after it. And it says fix the loop false option in the checkbox prompt, which we just so happen to have that problem. And so let's bump one more time. And in fact, this time, I'm gonna do a tiny bit different just to show you a different way. If you use this tilled little squiggly character here, and then you say, I'll even do 730. What this is going to do, you'll see is after installed, if we do npm ls, notice that we said I want 730, but it did 733. And if we look in our package JSON, you'll see that that little tilt characters there. So this is a special little character, you won't see it too often. But every now and then you will that means only update to the highest patch version, don't update to a minor. So at this point, it's determined that of all the packages that exist right now in time for this, that are not above a minor of three and not above a major of seven, there is a 733 is the highest version. You notice it doesn't list it here, but it does list it in the here. That's the thing I mentioned, it's kind of confusing to people sometimes, because this is your target. This is saying, this is what I want, roughly, I'm okay, if you give me any number here for this patch version. And that's what we got was 733. Okay, so let's run the program again. Go down to the bottom. Cool. See, it starts at acrobatics. Oh, look at that. It actually fixed it. Cool. Boom, boom, boom. Wait a couple seconds, which will matter in a moment. And there you have it. So that's an example of showing we did a minor bump. And what we could conclude from that if they did their job publishing the package properly, you know, bugs slip in sometimes. So that's how it goes. But with a minor bump, it's just going to be a new feature. So that's we did a minor bump so that we could get this access to this new property, right. And then we had two patch bumps that we needed to do in order to fix these bug fixes. If we go back to this just one more time. And we go previous, there's going to be one more, you'll see 733 before 800. Okay, so this is the highest patch and minor version that exists. Okay. Another way that you could do that without actually going to the repo, though, is you can do npm view. And you can do shorthand for this, it's V. And then you can do inquirer, oops, and you can do versions. So view versions. And what that will do is print out all the versions. So in case you wanted to see what ones exist, you know, just through the command line, you can do that, which is pretty neat. So 733 is our latest. You can also do the same thing and do dash dash JSON. Some people prefer this because it always prints out the full list. And it's in this kind of single column list format. But I usually do this since it's a little more truncated, it just depends. Now how you actually discover these new features is sort of a Pandora's box to a degree, it really just depends. You might be subscribing to some sort of service or blogs or Twitter or whatever it is that like, you know, kind of gives you some sort of notifications of new features or whatever. You might just hear it. Or what happens commonly is you'll do some sort of package bump for some reason. And you'll notice that it bumped up a version and then you might want to go read about why did it do that? You know, what's in the new version, I don't really have a better way to keep on top of packages. So if anyone does have any suggestions, go ahead and show it in the comments and we'll be grateful. But I just wanted to show you that like what it means the patch and the minor. And now we're going to move on to a breaking change example. So if we go into this code here, we'll notice that inquire eight doesn't give us a ton of information on what happened. But it does say that it drops support for node 10. Now this is a really common reason to be a breaking change. All right. So I'm going to show you an example real quick of upgrading to eight on an older node version to show that not working. So right now I'm using NBM, you might not be able to follow along here. If you're only installing one node version, you don't have a version manager, that's okay. You can see it through here. But if you wanted to follow along, probably easiest to use a version manager like NBM or N. So right now I'm currently on 1415. One, right. Now what I'm going to do is NBM use, and I'm going to do 8.17.0 because I have that installed. All right. Now I'm going to have to reinstall these packages at this point. And it should run fine if I were to run this again, because I haven't upgraded just yet. Just to show that. Okay. So currently all my stuff is supported. You notice that I don't get the syntax highlighting here, which is kind of interesting. So I wonder if they added that in a newer node version. Now, why someone might, you know, do this right here, which is drop support for a node version, because when new features come out in node, you know, sometimes you'll keep deprecated, which means you'll keep the functionality, but you'll have to add some extra code for like background support while you upgrade. And eventually what deprecated means is that you're going to stop supporting that at some time in the future. So if you ever see that deprecated message, that's what they're saying. They're like this, I'm going to drop support for this at some point in the future. So if you update your package, expect that you might lose that. And you probably want to get ready for that sooner rather than later. Now, because node 10 would have a bunch of new stuff from the old node version, they might want to just use that stuff natively. And eventually, you know, everyone kind of needs to stay current. So that's why they might do that. Just a real quick summation. So let's update to eight. Okay, so npm i inquirer at eight. Let's actually just do latest. Okay, so you can see that tag. So you can actually do at latest, and that will do if you remember, now that installed, if you do npm v, oops, npm v inquirer. Why can't I type ever? You'll see this dist tag latest. This is a really common way to just install whatever they have flagged as the latest version. So this will give us 8.1.2. Okay, and if we do npm ls, it'll list them all out. Oh, I wonder if an older version of Node, it doesn't actually truncate those. That was kind of interesting. Well, either way, let's try to run our program. Node index.js. And you'll notice that we immediately just get some sort of error when we try to do it. Okay, looks like they're using this catch block here. And it says unexpected token this brace. So we probably didn't have that type of functionality, we can guess from an older version of Node. So what we need to do is upgrade our node. In my case, I can just switch to 1415.1. Right? I'll install once again. And then I'll do node index.js. And my program works just fine, right? Now, what's cool about that is, did you see that", "name": "semver.txt", "vector": [0.006623724941164255, 0.0022929597180336714, -0.006212738808244467, -0.009692421182990074, -0.03345426544547081,

Wasn't that neat? So this is kind of an interesting example. I should have explained this a little bit beforehand. But I think this showcase it fine. showcases it fine. So if I pick, you know, Druid, I want to be Druid. And let's say, of course, as a Druid, I want to be proficient in animal handling, and acrobatics, why not. So I'm going to pick these two options. And look what happens when I press enter, you see that little loading spinner, we didn't used to have that feedback. And so this is sort of an example of at some point, let's find that. If you go back, now displays a loading spinner while asynchronously filtering over validating data. Cool. Cool. So this is an example where you want to upgrade to a major version, because there's a new functionality, we really want that loading spinner. That's awesome. But it's a breaking change, right? And so we would have to kind of figure out, all right, well, what is, you know, what's the breaking change here. So the best way to do that is to look for where the actual major bump happened. And in this case, it's going to be the first time after seven, since we're on seven something, we move that that first number up to eight. And so that's where they're going to just list any breaking changes, if they're maintaining the package properly and documenting it. Sometimes there'll be other ways that they document how to deal with a breaking change. If it's a major version, it might be in a post of theirs, if you just search it up, might be in the readme, if it's brand new. But a lot of times, if I don't find it really easily, this is where I'll look. And again, that's if you go to just the plain old repository from NPM or whatever, there's a releases tab here on the right, it might be different in the future, but usually just look for releases. And then you can go find that specific release. So that's one example of a breaking change. It's a really common example, where the node version updates, but really all you had to do was update your node, right? node version. Let me show you one more example of a breaking change that actually forces you to change your code. Okay, so fast forward through time real quick. And I've created a quick project here, just to speed things up. That's very simple. And it's using this package chalk, a lot of you will be familiar with it. It's a console dot log printing solution that will color your logs with different awesome little colors. Okay. If you look at my package JSON, I only have that one installed. And I'm starting at one one three, right. So I'm going to show you this program. But to briefly walk through it, I have a print method that I'm using. And really all this program is doing is you can normally do chalk dot magenta to print out a magenta text, which we'll see in a moment. And then I also have one that just prints out this like generic thing. So let's say I'm like logging a bunch of stuff, or whatever it is. And I want to be able to color things differently with chalk. What this print thing does is it uses this chalk has color method to see if the text is colored. And if it is, if it does have a color, it will just print it out the way that it is, else it'll make it green. That's it. So let's go back to the terminal here. And in this project, you'll see that in the first example, I print out purple, magenta, and the second one I print out green. And that's exactly what I expect when I look at the code here. So I decided there was a color, keep the color. Otherwise, if I didn't give you a color, make it green. It's pointless, but it'll illustrate the point. So now let's actually go and look at the chalk npm package. Chalk. We can go to this package, we'll go to the repository for this point, go to releases, they're already all the way up to 4.1.2. So we're really behind at this point. But releases, I clicked on 4.1.2, I actually need to click release, sorry, all of them. This is a really awesome project. They document it super well. So you know, so this is I wanted to show this because not only the code version of a breaking change, but just the maintainers of this are awesome. Okay, so what we'll actually do is we'll go back to one more, sorry, and we'll find two. So here's a major change. They have this awesome GIF and everything. And this is the really awesome moment where chalk introduced true color support, which is really fantastic. You'll see, I'll give you a quick little demo of it. But the point of it is that one, we want this new feature, we want this like tons and tons of color range and all that type of stuff. And I'll show you that in a moment. But what they do is they list breaking changes here. I love this. And so with this breaking change, you can look through and it requires no JS4, so pretty common what we just experienced. But also they removed chalk.hasColor. And we were using that. And that's really unfortunate for us, right? So let's show you that breaking our code real quick. So we're going to bump this up here, we're going to say npm i, I'm going to install chalk. And but we're going to do that at 2.0.0, let's say, and we really could just, you know, do whatever range. In fact, let me show you this, there's one more command that you want to know. So you actually can use this little up carry Chevron here to say, how about go ahead and grab me anything as long as it's not above three for a major version when I install it. Okay, and this isn't going to work for me, just so you can see, this is a common problem with ZSH and some other terminal shells, where what it's like thinking that it's some sort of matcher here. So what we're going to do is we're going to escape that character. If you ever had that problem, that's all you have to do. And that'll work. So now when we do npm ls, you'll notice that we didn't install to Oh, like we normally would have if we left that off, we'll actually install two for two. So we're saying, Hey, I want the latest version, as long as it's not higher than two. Cool. So now let's run that program again. It breaks, right? So chalk has color is not a function. Sad. Okay, well, let's go back to the docs. So they did tell us that. So let's kind of like simulate that we're in the real world. We heard there's true color support. And we're like, yes, give me that now. And so you go and you install that and then you get this error. So what I would do is I would go and first I'd try to like search up the error real quickly. If I don't find anything fast, I would go right to the repository and look at the versions and be like, okay, so I've got like two, version two or whatever, I'm gonna immediately go to where the breaking change happened. Because that's where the break should be. Not promising it always is. But it's where it should be. And it's the fastest place to look. And then here, you know, if they're nice, they listed it out. Oh, cool. Use the has ANSI package directly instead. I love it. Okay, so I'll click that they even give us a link. How cool are they? And when you come into here, there's this package and I'll be like, all right, well, I guess it looks like I can just call this now. So let's try it. So I'm going to do npm install has ANSI. I'm going to go over to my code. And I'm going to import that. So const has ANSI equals require has ANSI. And then I'm going to switch out this chalk has color because that's the thing that's broken for just has ANSI and see if it works. This is really how I develop things. Sorry if it's disappointing to you, but that's my mood. Okay, that didn't work. Unfortunately, must use import to load an ES module. Oh, that's really unfortunate. So we're using CJS right now. And they have this as import. So it looks like their current version is actually only supporting ES modules, which leads you down in a whole nother rabbit hole. So let's see what version that we got installed for them. Let's do a real world thing here. So npm ls, we have 500. Okay, so let's go to their versions and see, okay, require nodejs 12. This package is now pure ESM. Wow, we got lucky there, right? So maybe if we go back to four, we'll be fine. Right? So let's do this. npm i has ANSI at and then I'll let it be anything for so for 00. Four and up is fine with me. npm ls. Yeah, we're good. Let's try it now. And it worked. Look at that. That was real world. That wasn't planned. But pretty cool. So you can kind of see that in action. It's like, oh, well, things are crazy. And obviously, I had a little bit of knowledge about the ES modules thing. So I kind of knew where to look. But the point is that I can look at what version that I'm at currently with this npm ls, I can be like, Oh, I've got 50. Let's see what the breaking changes and that will lead you down the you know, trail of breadcrumbs to find what your problem is. It works for me a lot of times. Sometimes it doesn't. But you know, you got to have a lot of tools in your belt to solve these kind of problems. So this fixed our problem. And that shows a breaking change that you know, we wanted a new feature. Let's actually add that new feature real quick because you know, what's the point of doing the bump? Let me show you this. So I'm going to do an extra thing here. And I'm doing some crazy stuff. But really, what I'm trying to show here is that they have this like level that they added for different levels of color support. So in this case, it's like no colors. This is 16 colors, which is what they had before this version two oh, and then this is 256 color support, which is kind of common. And this is true support true color support, which is like 16 million. It's some crazy stuff. Now you're going to see the actual difference because notice that I'm logging the exact same color in all of them. Just to kind of show this, watch this is cool. Check this out. So this is true color, right? This is the actual color if we were to like hex it and you know, take that color and put it in the other browser. That's what it would look like. But you can see that it kind of like tries to pick the nearest one that it supports when it's only 256 colors. And then when it's 16 colors, it's not really even close, unfortunately. So this is the strides that they've made just to kind of showcase that this is the new feature that we wanted. So we wanted this feature and we had to install a breaking change to get it and then it broke our code. And so we had to go and look and see, okay, at least they documented that has colors not supported anymore. How can I find that out? And they were nice enough to give us a link to that has color package or has ANSI package. That's what it is. So now you've seen a breaking change. That's a simple node version bump, which is really, really common and also a breaking change, which is a code change. Now, as you've been seeing all of this, I hope that in the back of your mind, you're kind of starting to see how to actually develop software in a cool way. Like notice how nice it was for us to know and be notified that, hey, when you want to get this feature, you're going to actually have some breaking changes. Make sure that you check and see if you have to update your code. Sometimes you won't. And a lot of times you will, but they should have some documentation around that. And so now when you're developing software throughout your career, I hope you'll think about that pattern. There are other patterns out there, of course, but this is at least a nice one that has some sort of structure that says, when you write code, when you make a change, you have to think about your users. Am I going to break their stuff? I probably shouldn't do that right away. You know, let's make this a patch if we can. Let's make this a minor if it's a new feature and not put any breaking changes. Or if we really have to, if we feel like it's just too much work for us or we want some new functionality or whatever it is, there's a lot of reasons for it, we'll make a breaking change, but at least they'll know that it's that and we should document it. We should be the cool developers that let them know, hey, if you want this new feature, just so you know, you might run in these things, we broke these things. It is a breaking change, which means that your code might have to update or you need a new node version or something like that. Really, this just helps you become a better, more robust software developer by just learning how this thing works, semantic versioning, and incorporating that in how you write code, especially if other people are using your code and consuming packages and all that. But even if you're not using packages, I think it's a still a good way to deliver code in general. You know, you can document it however you want. But the point is, you selectively always think when you make code updates that anyone's going to use, you know, what kind of changes this? Is it just a little bug fix? Is it a new feature? Or does it actually break some existing code if people use it, and we should notify them? I believe that will sum up this video. I hope that this practical example of some larger used packages that, you know, are used by tons and tons of developers every day was a useful tool in seeing exactly how they distribute their packages and how you can go about troubleshooting breaking changes when you encounter them. But maybe even more importantly, while you're here, you get the gist of semantic versioning and what those little numbers mean, and the couple little special symbols in front of them. Thanks for watching, and I hope to see you in the next one.", "name": "semver.txt", "vector": [0.010338671505451202, 0.00665790680795908, 0.018753869459033012, -0.002996588358655572,

they're using it for their enterprise apps, they're converting old apps to it or using it for brand new apps. But there's one type of problem that TypeScript's not really equipped to solve right now and that's runtime type checking. Particularly when we're fetching resources from an API or something like that and we have to type check them, we really just have to tell TypeScript like this is what we expect them to be, but what they come back could be completely different and there's no way to do that until runtime. This is a problem that Zod is trying to solve which is a runtime type checking library and there's other ones around like IOTS that have been around for a bit but Zod is getting increasingly popular. You might have heard of TRPC, that's actually how I was introduced to it. It uses Zod under the hood. And what I realized that I wished I had known going back is that I would have learned Zod first and seen what it was doing and that I could add it to my project all by itself and get a lot of awesome benefits. And now as I'm using Zod more and more and more I thought I'd throw a little video together as an introduction to it, some of the properties of what its promises are, what it can immediately deliver for you, and some of the cool little helper utilities that it has. So if that interests you, let's start coding. So we're going to start off with a project that I've already created here to save some time. This will be up on GitHub and the link will be in the description. But all it is is it's a really simple just starter npm init with some TypeScript and the TypeScript init made so that we have our TS config going. You're probably familiar with this if you do any TypeScript type stuff. We do have Zod added, we're not using it just yet, but we will. And we have node daemon with TS node added so that we can watch our files for saves and stuff like that, and it'll automatically rerun. So we can use the start script here to start that daemon up. And here we have an output here. So all we have is this TSX or this TS file. And let me get rid of this and hide the sidebar so you can have some real estate here. So what's happening is we have an async function. And that's probably the one thing to note here on this project that might be a little weird for you is there's this experimental warning, fetch API is experimental. That's because I'm on node 18 right now. You might be further in the future, or depending on when you're doing this, but you don't have to use the native fetch. If you're worried about that, or if you're having issues, you can just use node fetch or isomorphic fetch or any, you know, Axios or whatever fetch library you want on node because it's not going to matter. It's all the same for what we're doing. In this instance, I'm just using the native one. So with async function, fetch person, we're just awaiting a fetch, and we're capturing it in a results variable. And we're fetching the Star Wars API, which is a sort of like open source dev API for kind of testing out different JSON queries and API responses. So from that, then we're going to call our function in the same line here, and then on it and we're going to get this person back and we're going to log it out. And that's what we're seeing here over on the side as a results there. So we don't have any types or anything like that yet. And that's on purpose because I want to show what the problem is and what Zod is solving or one of the things that it's solving. So the problem right now is we have this person and it's an any type. So I'm not really getting any TypeScript goodness. If I try to access name on this, that will work. But that's just because it happens to be there. If I did wolf on it, it's going to tell me that's just fine and that it exists or whatever. Okay. So what I want to do is I want to be able to go up here and let's add a type real quick. So I'm going to do an interface person. And on that, I'm going to say it has a name that's a string. And I'm going to use height here. And I'm going to say it's a number even though it's not. Let's just like make a little problem for us in the future so that we can showcase it in this demo. And then I'm also going to go a step further. I'm going to say lightsaber colors is a string array. So that's definitely that whole properties not on there. So the problem with this right now is that even if I type it like this, these properties are kind of a lie. And I'm going to show that real quick by saying, well, let's step down here and say there are multiple ways that you could type a fetch response. But really, a fetch is going to come back as any and you kind of I like to think of it this way, you're kind of lying to TypeScript, because you have to tell it I, hey, you know, let's for example, this results, hey, this is going to come back as a person, that's what you need to do. That's one way to do this. And when you're doing that, it's not really guaranteed that that's going to happen. You don't know even if you built the API yourself, you've done version updates. So the code itself is in a state where it doesn't know what the response types are or anything like that. You just have to tell it like, hey, I know what I'm doing. This is what's going to come back. So we'll just type based on that. If you work with TypeScript a lot, you're comfortable with it, you do API type stuff, you're going to be familiar with this. Other languages have runtime ways to solve this. But for now, this is what we have. And it can work fine, you just have to update it. But it can really as in a scaled project, it can kind of get annoying. And you can get some really nasty bugs that can be tricky to track down sometimes. So we could do it that way. We could also do, we could cast it as a person here, if we want to, typically, you want to avoid casting with as if you can avoid it other ways. But in this case, it's all the same thing. I'm going to do it the way that I like to do it. So we can move forward. I like to do promise person here. I know some other people do too. And really, it doesn't matter in this instance, it's just because, at least I don't think it does. It's because when I look at this function, I can tell what the return type is really quickly. So if I, you know, I'm perusing through the code, that's the only reason I like it that way. If we go to the fetch person here, we'll notice that it returns a promise person. And it would say that no matter what we did it, it would infer it because TypeScript is pretty smart there. So now I can do person dot name, right? And it's actually going to autocomplete for me, it's going to tell me all the properties that I have. But notice that it tells me I have lightsaber colors here. Okay, well, you know, what is that type? Oh, it's a string array. So I should be able to get zero on that, right? Your app crashed. Why? Because you tried to read a property on undefined, but TypeScript couldn't help you couldn't tell you that that doesn't exist because you lied to it, you told it that it existed. So this is where Zod comes into play. This is pretty cool. What we're gonna do is we're gonna just import Zod. We're gonna import Z from Zod, I'll let that complete itself. And then I'm going to get rid of this type for a moment. I'll just comment it out so you can see it for reference. And then what we're going to do is we're actually gonna make a regular variable with Zod. So we'll call this person, I'm gonna name it uppercase as well, you could do lowercase, some people like it either way, you'll see why in a moment. And then I'm going to do z dot object here. So when I call z dot object, it uses this sort of builder pattern in Zod, where you say, okay, you can kind of chain these methods on to each other, you'd probably familiar with this like map filter, reduce all that type of stuff. So we have a name, and we want to call it z dot name. Oops, not name, z dot string, please apology me. And so this is essentially how you're typing, you're saying this, I have an object with this shape. And it might be familiar to you if you do react prop types as well, things like that. I can say height is the z dot number here. All right. And then let's say lightsaber colors. What we would do here is we do z dot array. And that's an array of what what's an array of z dot strings. See, it's kind of interesting, you pass it into this thing. Now we're almost there. But we just have a we have a variable. Now we don't have a type. So you might think you do type of but the way that you actually want to do this is you want to use Zod's inference type. So now we're going to say type person equals z dot and it has an infer method here. And then you do type of and this is person here, this variable, that might be a little confusing to you because it's uppercase person, you could do lowercase here if you want, it doesn't really matter. So now I have this type person. And then we are almost there. But we actually need to still parse it because notice that we didn't add Zod as a development dependency, this actually is in our dependencies, it's going to be part of our code. So we need at runtime for this to run and check the types and how we're going to do that is we say const, I'm just gonna name it parsed results. However you want to do it, you take the type, which is person here, and then you have this parse function. And then you're going to pass it in something to parse. And then you have that and then what I'm going to do is I'm going to return that parsed results. Okay. And then what I'll do here, well, let's just run this first. So let's see what happens. So when I run that, I still get an app crash, right? But notice that I get this nice little bit of syntax here, where if we kind of go all the way up, try to keep this higher so that I'm not blocking it, you'll notice that we get this Zod error and you can read it up here or down here, it actually is going to try and hone you in on right here, Zod intro index.ts, actually right here, index.ts 21. So this is where the error is occurring, line 21. But the main thing that I usually use just to kind of glance at it is you can see it has these two issues. And it says, expected a number and received a string. And then it also expected an array here and it received undefined. So essentially at runtime here, you're getting instead of it actually getting the point where it would randomly try to access this part in your code, which could be, you know, deeply nested somewhere in your logic, you're getting it right at runtime. Even if you don't use anything, let's actually show that that probably be better as a representation, huh? So we'll just console log person again here. And when I rerun this, let's give it a second here. There we go. I'm still going to get this. So even though we haven't illegally used this object, we're going to get an error while we're developing right away. And that's really the value here to me. This is the main thing that I think Zod is solving. This is the main thing I'm interested in for and I think many other people. So let's fix this real quick. And so we can kind of see it running normally and get some of the cool helpers and stuff like that. So I'll get rid of that old type. And then what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna get rid of this property because we know this doesn't really exist. But let's just hone in on this for a minute. This is pretty interesting. If we run this again, what's going to happen here is we're only going to have this one error issue now that it expected a number and it received a string. And this expected number received string here. So all I need to do is actually tell it that it's a string, because that's actually what it is. And then now we're going to be fine. And you probably can't see this, I'm kind of blocking it. But now we're just logging out this object here. Okay, let me hide myself real quick, just so you can see. Now there's this object here that's being printed out, because I can't make the terminal go down any further. And that's kind of interesting. So what's happening here is that if I console log right here, I'm going to say fetch results, and then I have just results here. So this is the original results we got from the fetch. And then right after it, I'm going to console.log, I'm just going to put some stuff here, Zod results, we'll say Zod parsed. And this is parsed results. And I'm already making an error because I'm a noob. Okay, so I'm just logging those two things out. And what I'm trying to show here is that when I when I log out the actual fetch results, it's the whole thing. But when I log out the Zod parsed results, it's just the things that we told it it would have, which is pretty cool. So it's actually paring down all this information and saying, look, you're only going to get what you expect out of this type, which is another nice little thing that kind of cleans that up, you don't have a bunch of dangling properties that you have access to that you don't know that you have access to, you can have to be explicit here, which I personally really like. Now, we can still use these properties, the way we expect here. So we can we can get auto completion and everything like that. But let's show a couple more features before we call it here on what what else Zod brings to the table besides this, you know, base functionality, which is really, really cool. But there's some other cool helpers that it has. So if I do person dot height, and we log this out, we're gonna see here that we get this, it's this color, because it's a string, we get this 172, we get Luke Skywalker for the name here. So let's actually grab a couple other properties real quick off of this. So I can show some of the cool helpers that you can get here. So first off, you can add these little chains onto this. And there's a little min helper here. So I could say, Hey, I want the name to be minimum between one, why'd you do that? One and then the max would be 100 characters here. It's not going to show anything right away when I do this. But if I were to pare this down to two, you'll see we get this too big error, this is pretty cool. So we're actually constraining even more than TypeScript right here, we're saying, hey, this string came in, and I only want it to be two characters here. This is what I expect. You know, that's what I've prepared my app to work with, for whatever reason. And you get a nice little message here. That's pretty cool. So we'll return that back, let's just leave that one. And if you look at some of our other data, we have like a homeworld, right? So let's say we want the homeworld, we can do z dot string. And we can do dot and it's a URL, they actually have a URL helper that will check this, this is pretty", "name": "zod-intro.txt", "vector": [0.028849538415670395, 0.0025306304451078176,

So when I let's just put a URL on the height as an example to show what would happen if it was the wrong thing back. And here we'll get this validation error, invalid URL for that. Okay. So let's pair that back right here, we'll leave that. So it has a bunch of cool little helpers like that. It's got an email helper, it's got a UUID helper, you see this min and max, and there's a bunch of other stuff, we're just going to cover a couple real quick. So let's do one more like more complex type here, we could do the films. And we know that we can do z dot array, right? And then what we could do is z dot string. And then we can still keep chaining onto that and say each of those is a URL here. So that's going to pass but what if we did email here? All right, let's change this real quick. So now when I do email, it's going to give me a bunch of invalid emails, I can actually pass an object into this particular validation, there's a bunch of things I could pass, but I'm only going to show you the message at heart, I'm talking there, I can do this message here. And I can say something like, films must be an array of valid URLs. Okay, do a little bit of massaging reformatting here. So here we get this cool little message films must be an array of valid URLs. If I change that back to URL, like I expected it to be, there we go. Everything's working great. So you can actually build on the messages yourself, which is really cool and like kind of check this data in a bunch of different ways. So we had taken a step back there, we had films, we said that's an z dot array is odd array of strings that are of the URL type with this message if it fails, let me show you one more thing that gets really powerful here. This is really interesting. So if you want to go above and beyond just checking, you can actually transform the data to remember how I mentioned that 172 is just kind of this random number for height. Well, that's centimeters here. But I want the users to know that. So I can actually do transform on this height here. And I'm going to when I transform, I get a callback of the value. So let's just take Val, and then let's make a string interpolation of Val with centimeters tacked onto it like so. And then you'll see that's what we get back in our output here. 172 centimeters, which is pretty cool. And I can really do anything I want here. I could actually take this value. This is pretty nutty. And I could say number Val on this thing. So we could cast this to a number here. And what's going to be pretty nutty about this is notice that it changed its syntax highlighting down here. If I hover over this person type, notice the heights now a number is just automatically inferred that from the type that came back here. And now when we go to access this, I can say height dot to fixed, and that's actually going to auto complete and work correctly. There's another way to do this. Just so you know, you don't have to do transform if you're actually doing type coercion. They've added this in some recent version camera when but you can do z.coerce. Number, notice, I don't have to put the type I can just say, hey, whatever it is, if it's coercible to a number, go ahead and do that. And you can course to all the primitives. So you can see from that, that's as far as I'm going to go on this. But you can see that thought actually has a lot of powerful things you can do here. And what I like about this pattern is that you sort of have this source of truth pattern here where you, you kind of define above and beyond what the type is, you know what the constraints are of it, whether it's a URL, a min, a max, if you do this min and max on a number, it's going to change the error to say, oh, it has to be between this number range instead of this many characters. It's a really nice, friendly API to use. And when you come back and you look at the code, you can get a sense of what that data is being returned. And I really like that. So I've only got to use Zod so far in some of my little fun side projects, but I'm really looking forward to adding it to some enterprise apps that I work on that I want to see how it can pay out. I really do believe that this is going to be a really popular library coming up to pair with TypeScript so that you can catch bugs and errors early, right away, as soon as like the API changes or as soon as you try to use it in a specific way that you shouldn't be. As usual, I hope the way that I've covered this content has been helpful for you. You can go in the comments and let me know if not, or if you'd liked it. That's awesome. I'd love to hear that. But the way that I like to teach is kind of to take a more, a little bit more thorough step-by-step process of kind of digging into some of the initial properties. Like we obviously could have gotten a lot more depth here and I know it's an intro, but I'd rather actually go through and show you some of the patterns that I find very promising and that I've spent a little bit of time with and that hopefully capture kind of the spirit of why you should be intrigued about this and maybe why the TypeScript community in general has a growing interest in this project. If this was helpful for you, I'd appreciate it if you give a like and subscribe, and I hope that I will see you in the next one.

{"content": "Hey everyone, welcome to Swashbuckling with Code. I'm Jimmy Cleveland, and today we're going to be setting up Next.js' preview mode using Contentful's preview API. Now I know this video might seem a little bit long to some of you for setting up a preview mode, and that's fine. There are already examples like the Next.js documentation and some other things to just quickly figure it out yourself if you wish for that, but I'm really trying to go step by step through this and walk you through what it is, how it works, and kind of explain some troubles I've had with other systems and stuff like that along the way. I personally think that's really valuable and it's stuff that I would want to know, so that's why I'm taking the time to make this video. But I want to be considerate of your time, so I'm also going to have timestamps if you want to jump around to specific things that you might need. And I'll also have the repo hosted, which I'll have a link to in the description for the code at the end of it if you just want to glance at how my config is and figure it out yourself. So before we get into the code, let me give you a brief little summary of why something like this even exists, this preview mode. One challenge that I and many others have faced when working with statically generated content is that preview can be a little bit more challenging. Many traditional CMSs, like WordPress and such, have their own preview mode built in. But when you're using a headless CMS or a headless pattern, like if you're using a headless WordPress, and then you're doing statically generated content, that actually becomes a little bit more difficult of a challenge to give them a responsive preview mode. So each build system, such as Gatsby, has invented their own way to alleviate these pains through some really awesome engineering things to kind of speed up the process and make it more fluid. But today I'm going to go over Next.js because I believe that they have one of the most elegant solutions, if not the most elegant solution, for this that I think is very simple and very effective. Hopefully by the end of this, you'll have a pretty good mental model of how that all works, all the problems and the solves in general, and how Next.js preview works so that you can customize your own project to your particular needs. Okay, picking up where we left off last time, if you haven't watched those videos, they're going to be in the description and in the playlist here. It's the whole Contentful plus Next.js playlist that I'm doing right now. But for a quick recap, or for those who don't want to go back and watch that and just want to see preview in action here, what we've got here is we have Contentful being hit, which I'll go to that Contentful space later when we need it. But for now, we are getting a very simple model with a few fields. We're hitting that client, and we are using getStaticPaths to generate out all the different routes for every single slug that we find for a product review, and then getStaticProps here to generate out each individual page by fetching that one by ID or slug or whatever you want to call it. So now let's get into the preview functionality. And to start there, we want to understand how this API structure works really briefly. So there's this folder that it starts with whenever you make a Next.js project. It's this API folder, and they start out with this hello. So let's see how that behaves. You can see in the syntax here, it might look a little bit Express-like to you, and that is what Next.js also refers to it as. They have an API. It's not a one-to-one, but it is very similar to Express with this rec and res, request and response objects. So you can do res.status, set a 200 status, return some JSON. Let's see that in action real quick. So coming back over to here, I'm going to start up my server. I'm now on a preview branch. That's the branch we'll be on in the repo if you want to follow along or just compare your code or whatever if you have issues. So when we do that, we'll go back to the browser, and we'll hit this route here, and you can see it loading fine. But let's go to slash API slash hello, and then we get this response here, right? So that's pretty simple. So in order to initiate preview mode, you can go to the docs here. I'll link this in the description, but you could just search Next.js preview in Google or wherever, and they have some really nice documentation that kind of walks you through setting it up. I'm going to distill a little bit of this. They have some really good examples here for each database, but I found them to be pretty involved. When you're kind of first starting, there's a lot of like abstraction and stuff like that, which is good pattern wise, but might be a little difficult to just get right into it. So that's what I'm going to kind of do is keep it simple. But walking down here, you'll see that they recommend making a sort of route that has this code right here. Okay, so that's what we're going to do. Essentially, we're going to come back to our code, we're going to make a new file, and anything you make in this API one is going to use this format. It's going to use this little express-like server. It's pretty cool. We're going to name it preview.js. And so whatever you export here needs to be the default export. It's a common thing to call the function a handler. You could call it whatever you like. And then here, you're going to get a rec and a res back. Call those whatever you like as well. And let's just start by console logging that out when we hit that route. Let's just do response. Okay, we'll go back to our browser. Hit here and instead of slash hello, we'll do slash preview. And it's going to hang because we didn't end the response at all. But that should be enough to at least go to our server and see this giant thing dumped out. Okay, I'm not gonna scroll all the way through that and put you through that misery. But API resolved without sending a response to API preview. So they give you a little hint there, you kind of need to resolve that somehow. And in particular here, conveniently, right at the bottom, there's this set preview data that's on the response thing and among some other things. You can see dot end, which we're going to use as well. So let's do that. All we need to do here is do res dot set preview data. And that takes an object and a lot of the times you'll just leave this empty. This is just to flag on preview mode with a cookie that I'll show you. But you could do something like my key, my Val, you know, pass a key value and I'll show you where you get that later. For now, we'll just do res dot end. Go over to the browser, re hit this preview. And you'll notice that why did it did actually hit it? Or did my refresh not work? I don't think it worked. We'll do slash preview, press enter. And there you go, we should get this white screen because we ended it. But notice that we have this cookie over here and it's there's a lot of zoom going on here. So it might be hard to see. But in particular, what's interesting is this next preview data is going to pop up here and it's this hash. So you know, for security reasons, they aren't putting anything on there. But this cookie is something that is going to be unique every time that the server runs, which is pretty cool. And so that will start over every single time. So it'll have to be reflagged. But what that does is it's going to make it to where when we go to, let's say, product product one, we'll still have this cookie on our machine here. And we will until we essentially restart the server in this case. Or if it were production, you know, we'd have to clear it ourselves or whatever when it expires. Let's go back to our code real quick and see something interesting. If we go into this slug where we're processing all of our products in particular, and we have some methods running, if we were to log out this context object, let's see what we get. So we'll do console dot log. And we'll just do, let's see, context. I don't know why I bothered to type that up. Okay, so we'll hit this again real quick to get that log triggered. And then we come back down here. And you'll see we get this context when we hit and notice that it says preview true preview data, my key, my val. So this is how you would get those properties that you want to send yourself. And you could do anything with those you want. There's lots of options there. We won't need it for the rest of this video. So I'm going to kill it in a moment. But just so you know, if you want to kind of like send some data along and react to that, that's a cool way to do that for preview mode only. So we really care that the preview mode is true. First of all, that's one thing that we want to react to. Now I want to show you something interesting that happens here. There's some pretty cool stuff that's happening that might not be obvious at first. If we do npm run build, sorry, that'll build real quick here. And then we'll do npm start. So we're using like an actual production build here. What we want to see is anytime we hit this, I'm going to refresh this page. And we come back into here, you'll notice that no nothing was logged here like that the server wasn't hit. There isn't that log of the context object that we just saw. So I'm just going to refresh it a couple times. Nothing happens. Go back to the terminal. Nothing happens. But what happens if we go to notice we didn't have our cookie anymore because we restarted the server. So if I go to API slash preview, I'm now going to get that cookie. Okay. And when I go back to product now, let's see if it does it again. When I reload, you'll see that this context was logged out this time. That's kind of interesting, huh? It might be particularly interesting, particularly can't speak, because this get static props is not it's supposed to be static. It's not supposed to run. You know, it's not get server side props. So it's like, okay, well, how's it doing that? Well, what's cool about next JS is they've realized a pretty simple solution to this whole preview problem is that when you are trying to make drafts in your content editor, you're not like the end client, you know, the user, the typical person that's going to be using your website, you're the person like editing it. And so you don't need to do a full rebuild of all the pages every single time and, and try to go through the problems. If you've ever experienced a static site generation and preview mode, you probably know what I'm talking about. But if not, just trust me, it can be a real pain if you're just trying to do the whole build over and over again. What they're opting to do is say, you know what, let's kind of switch back over to a server side sort of behavior. And let's do things on request whenever we see the preview flag sent, because this particular person one probably already has the site, you know, cache to some degree, because they're hitting it. But two, they don't really need the super duper efficiency of statically generated stuff. You know, server side is going to be good enough for them. For this purposes, this actually ends up being a really elegant solution. I like it a lot. It's cool that they've made this single function, you don't have to do something special with it, it just kind of opts in or opts out of rerunning every single time. And that's going to be crucial for us to be able to, you know, get things on demand as we're doing a preview mode. Okay, so hopefully that rant made a little bit of sense to you. But if not, I apologize. Hopefully it was useful. So we'll come back to preview here. And the next thing we're going to do, we do not need these values, we just need the empty object here. And we want to start getting some params off of this query request. So if we didn't need rec, we could just do an underscore there, but we are going to use it. It's just a common thing, just so you know, if you're not using like the first argument of a function. We're going to do, we're going to pull product ID, that's what I'm going to name it when I pass it in, off of rec.query. Okay. So now, let's see what that is by console logging, product ID, product ID. So now if I just go here and I hit, I'm going to hit that same endpoint, API slash preview again. You know, I didn't pass anything in, so we should see an undefined for that. Hmm. What happened there? API preview ended fresh. Oh, silly me. What am I doing? I need to rebuild. I'm in production mode. It's not updating to my changes. I'm very sorry about that. System run dev, restart that over. I just had it in production because I wanted to show you the actual, you know, preview in production setup. So let's re-hit this route here. Go back to here. And there we go. So we've got this product ID, product one, and that's working great. So you can see now we can pull some params off and start doing some stuff with that. So the next thing we'll do is we'll head over to the Contentful space and we'll get the preview access token and start to set up like preview and all that. So for now, we'll only need the access token. So over here in my Contentful space, what you can do is you can go to settings if you're following along or doing your own thing. You can go to, we will do content preview in a moment, but for now we need API keys. So there's this next JS key thing here. And don't worry about any secrets. I am going to regenerate them. So normally I don't show people this stuff, but we already have the space and the content delivery. Now we're going to want this content preview access token. So I'm going to copy that. We'll go back over to our code and in our.env.local here, we're going to make a Contentful preview access token. You can name it whatever you really want here. I'll paste that token here. Why we specifically need this token as this is how we're going to get Contentful and many, you know, other CMSs that I've worked with have this idea of a preview mode where they have a different API that you hit for like draft content. And that's what we're meaning to get here. So in order to do that, if we go back over to our slug page, you'll notice that we have this like Contentful.createClient or whatever. And we're doing this access token and this process.env is using, or it's pulling off Contentful access token right now. We're going to pull off the preview token to do that. By that I mean, you know, getting preview data, getting draft data. So what will happen first though, it's going to make sense at this point. We were going to do it earlier in one of the previous videos, but it was a little bit too early now. It kind of makes sense to move this to somewhere else. So I'm going to abstract this code to a", "name": "nextjs-contentful-preview.txt", "vector": [0.00753394840285182, 0.011919178999960423, 0.005875128321349621, -0.005294034723192453,

that. And that's because we're going to need two different clients. I'll make a utils. I've got too many things going on in my brain, sorry. And then in this utils folder, we'll just do a Contentful.js file. Okay. So for now, just to get things working, we will cut, actually we'll do both of those. We will also want the import. We'll move that over to here. And oh, I did folder. Whoops. Lots of mistakes. So we'll do Contentful.js, a file, not a folder. And now we have this client, which we want to export. I don't know why it's a var. Let's see. So we'll do export const client. Okay. Back here, we're going to import that now. And then say client and Contentful. And actually, rather than do it that way, I'm going to do star as Contentful. So I have the whole thing. And then down here, we would change this wherever we use client, we would change this to Contentful.client. You'll see why I'm doing that in a moment. Okay. So it's just these two spots, get static paths, Contentful.client, and get static props, Contentful.client. Okay. So back over to here. Why we've done this is because we really don't want to be creating these clients over and over and over again. Okay. I probably should have left that. But when we go to, when we want to use preview, sometimes we're going to want to use regular data and sometimes we're going to want to use preview data. But the problem with this is when we instantiate this client, we have to give it the right access token and the host URL and all that stuff to use the correct API, right? But if we want to switch back and forth between the two, what, you know, if you're a little more naive, we might do is, you know, do some sort of like conditional here where we're like, hey, is it preview mode? Because we saw we could get that off of context. Hey, if you are preview mode, you know, use this client, otherwise make this other client. But the problem is, any time every little page runs, it's going to be recreating these clients instead of using more of a singleton pattern where you just make them one time and then import them. So now we're going to export const preview here. Let's actually call it preview client. And then I'll do Contentful dot create client, same thing, but I'm going to pass some different stuff here now. So pretty much the same thing for these two. I could have just copied this whole thing, couldn't I? And for Contentful access token, we'll say preview access token. All right. And the last thing we have to do is you have to specify a host, which is optional. They'll default to cdn.contentful.com. That's what's being done up here. But in this one, we're going to do preview.contentful.com. So now that we're exporting these two different clients, they're just like pre-made the first time that this file is imported, and then we reuse that over and over again. We imported it as Contentful, so I could access either one there. We can keep this await Contentful dot client because in get static pass, we're always going to get, you know, we can just hit the main API for that. I guess you might want to switch this to be able to do preview or non depending on if you had like brand new URLs that didn't exist yet or brand new slugs. But for now, we'll keep this. We'll just generate all of them based on the production URLs. And we'll do the switch here. So in get static props, we have this await Contentful client. Actually, I didn't want to do that because what I'm going to do is we'll keep this like client pattern, and then we'll say const client equals, and this is where we can say, hey, context dot preview. Remember, that was a true false Boolean. So we'll say if that's true, use Contentful dot preview client. Otherwise, use Contentful dot client. I'm going to format this. I don't know why it's not formatting for me. There are, you know, a multitude of ways that you could handle this. But I think this makes some sense. So now when we hit this route, it's essentially going to, you know, on production, it's going to first build them with this Contentful dot client, the regular mode, the production mode, whatever you want to call it, as it generates out all the pages. But then when someone comes here with that special preview cookie, we're going to switch to the preview client. And then everything else will be business as usual. Pretty nice, huh? So let's see that in action. What we'll do is we'll go back to our Contentful, go to content, and let's go to product one here. Now product one has the very first product. If I were to type draft stuff here in the heading, you'll notice it's saving, if you saw that. I'm not going to publish, though. I'm going to leave it just changed for now. And if I go back to my server, let's go to just product, product one again, and we should see draft stuff, right? Okay, so that's because we have these cookies. So let's clear those cookies real quick. And let's refresh. See, it went away. So that's how it's going to work. So it's just we, we, anytime we hit this, or the first time that we build all of our regular users, if we're in production, they're going to see this code. No one's ever going to see the draft stuff, unless they know how to activate this special little preview token cookie thing. So let's flip that back on again, just to see that. Go back to preview. And we really don't have to pass a slug. We could just hit whatever, because we'll get the tokens. We haven't set up that measure yet. And then if we go back to the page, beautiful. So we'll do redirecting and all that stuff next. So now let's set it up so that when we hit our preview, whatever slug parameter we pass there, it's going to redirect to this page. So it's essentially what we're acting as is sort of a link that you could give someone that will give them a special parameter that's like, hey, activate preview mode and add a cookie to their browser, and then redirect them to the page that they were kind of trying to go already. And that's going to be especially useful and contentful when we add preview links to each page. So when we come back here, we'll go back to this preview. And instead of res.end, I'm going to use res.redirect. Some of you might be scared right now. Let me actually show you why. If you go over to the documentation here, let's see, they did that. That's cool. Preview mode enabled. There should be a point here. They have this like kind of full example we're going to come close to as we step through it. But right here, you'll notice there's this res.redirect. Notice that they particularly say we don't redirect to rec.query slug as that might lead to open redirect vulnerabilities. So a lot of times you want to be really cautious with how you use res.redirect. And let me just give you a real quick example of why. So let's say that I redirect and I'm like, hey, you know what, just redirect them to product ID. So let's say, hey, if they type in their query params or whatever, we're going to send them all along onto the product ID. So if they type product one, then we'll send them to product one or whatever. Pretend that that's how our URL structure worked. Okay, it's just like everything's slash at the root. Now what could happen here is now that that's working, I'll go back to API preview. We'll do product ID equals. So if I go to product one, that's going to take me to, you know, API product one. And if I did slash, it would take me to slash product one or whatever. Okay. But let's, let's go back here and do API slash. And then maybe let's do something like preview and then product ID equals HTTPS colon slash slash Google.com. All right. Let's type two letters there. And if I hit enter here, it's actually going to full on redirect me to Google.com because we just said redirect to whatever they type in there. And that's really bad. That's a really dangerous vulnerability to have because what would happen there is if someone else could, you know, give someone a link to your site, let's say that you were a bank or a PayPal or something like that, you're using some sort of service. You could fully redirect them with a query parameter to your site that looked just like the other site. You could imitate it and you could like get them to type in their credit card data. And that's pretty scary. Among a bunch of other attacks that could happen. Right? So that's why the caution there. Okay. So, you know, you just got to be careful with, with, with how you do redirect here. So what people will do commonly is some of the examples show like right head here. And so you would do like right head with a 307. So it's temporary and not permanent. So we tell the, you know, SEO crawlers not to change their links and all that stuff. But what we're trying to do here is you could just say like set location. Let me actually type it out just so you know. And then we would be like, okay, let's set it to slash product. So go away. And then like product ID. So you could do something like this, which is a, you know, a pretty common solve here. In this case, I guess we wouldn't really even need it. But let's say that you wanted to send them here. You could just use right head as one alternative. I've seen some people recommend to do that, but we're going to stick with the res dot redirect because I am not too worried about that just because I'm not going to be ever just sending them directly here. You'll notice in the next JS docs that we referred to, they did like post dot slug. So they have like a qualified link. We'll kind of get into why that can matter in a moment. But what I can do here is I can do the same thing. It's a product slash product ID that I did before. And so the thing about this is, if you ever try to like do the whole thing that we did before, I know I'm taking a little bit of time here. It's just a pretty valuable thing to kind of have in your head. You know, feel free to skip forward in the timeline. If you're not interested in this, I should have said it beforehand, but it's pretty useful thing to know. So if you go to preview, we're about done here. And then we were to do product ID. And I did the same thing where I did that like product ID equals HTTPS colon slash slash google.com. And I hit that. Notice it's going to take me to slash product. So it won't actually work if someone tries to spoof a URL here, because I've hard set it to go to that product here. So because we have that URL structure first, I'm not as worried about that. But you know, just so you know, be cautious, do your own research and all that. All right, cool. So now let's actually do it for real. API preview, and we'll do the product ID is equal to product one, we hit that, and it will redirect us here. Pretty cool, huh? So if we were to clear that, we were to go there, we have a regular production mode. And then we go back to this route right here. And we hit it again. See, it's like seamless, it just kind of redirects us right here. And it sets our cookie and we get the draft mode stuff. I think you get it. So let's move on to setting this up in Contemple. So in Contemple here, we can come over and what we want to do is go to settings. And you do content preview. And mine's a little bit zoomed in here, just so you can see better. But you should see this kind of like blank set up a content preview page if you haven't ever done it before. You click it. And then here, you set a name, I happen to have next JS preview as a name. Cool, that works. I don't think you need a description. And then here, the content preview URLs, you get to pick for every like content model what you want the link to be, like if you want to turn them on and how you want them to go there. And this is pretty neat if you want to do like some crazy component stuff where you're previewing like just a certain type of component, and not like a whole page. But for now, we're just previewing the whole page. So if we go to product review now, notice they give you this cool example, right here, your website.com such product product review, entry field slug. Okay, so the part that we really care about here is this entry field slug thing going on. And looks, I've already got it from when I was messing around with it. Okay, I guess I'll just use that for now. So we want to type HTTP. For our case, we're using localhost 3000. A note on that in a moment, then we'll do slash API, like we did before preview, and then set a slug here, we want to do we want to do product ID equals. And then this entry, this is a contemptful specific thing, entry field product ID, let me show you what would happen if you were to put like slug or whatever they started out with, it should give you a warning that tells you that ID doesn't exist on this content type, which is really cool of them. So we'll say, yeah, we want to use product ID. And we want to save that. Perfect. Now, the note about localhost 3000, is that I'm using this for preview mode, you know, just to kind of like demo it and showcase it, because it's going to be faster to show it this way. But commonly, how I would do this is I would actually set this to the production URL, or possibly a separate server that specifically serves for preview purposes, if you want to do that, you know, maybe you've got a really big enterprise setup going on, but a production URL actually will work just fine. Wherever our site is hosted, we could point to that with HTTPS, please. With that, we can go to the production site. And the cool thing about that is that it's going to be reflective, I love this about Next.js and how they implemented preview, it's going to be reflective of the real data, the actual production data. So someone who's a content editor, and you're in here, whether it's you or other people, maybe on your team, or whatever, you know, I don't know your purposes for what you're using this for. But anyone who's using this as a content editor can see their preview data with the actual like production hosted site. So they have pretty good assurances that it's going to work or what it's going to look like. I just think that's a really cool, elegant solution. I've played around with I've had a lot of fighting with, for example, Gatsby Cloud, though it has improved quite a bit originally, you know, trying to redo these builds every single time that it previews and the delays, and they've made a lot of cool engineering improvements to make that better and better and better. But really, I just love this elegant solution with Next.js preview of like, let's just use a cookie that gets flagged that, you know, only they're going to set somehow, and that will show them the preview data and the regular users won't ever see it. You would want to add a little secret for a little bit of extra", "name": "nextjs-contentful-preview.txt", "vector": [0.014989578165113926, 0.012321029789745808, 0.005612689536064863,

And we'll do that in just a moment. But let's make sure that this works. So now if we go back to content, and we go to product one, we'll see that there's this open preview button that used to be grayed out and is now here, because we just enabled it for this content type, the product review type. If I click that, it'll actually open a new tab and take me right there, which is pretty freaking sweet. So let me show that again by clearing my cookies. So we don't have preview mode on right now, right? And then we go here, and we click this, and it opens it, and it instantly went to that URL, we got redirected here to, you know, the actual product, product one, and we have draft mode on, which is pretty sweet. So now if we go back and we're a content editor, we could, I don't know, change some more stuff, draft subhead here. We do have to wait for it to save. And this is the one gotcha that I haven't figured out quite yet. I haven't spent a lot of time looking into it. You do have to reload every time that that saves. It's not a huge deal, but it'd be cool if there was like a webhook or something that would auto reload. Again, there might be a way to do that. I haven't spent a lot of time looking into it because I just haven't really needed to. But you do have to refresh. But you know, it's pretty fast. Like, let's just kind of show that in regular time. So let's, you know, delete that. Do that thing. There's a little debounce time waiter. It saves. As soon as it's saved, we refresh. And boom, it's there. Cool. So that's pretty sweet. So we'll do that. We'll get rid of, we'll get rid of this for now. I'll just leave that. And let me also show you what's cool about this is this works for every page. The way that we've set it up is really neat, because now if I go to ABC one, two threes page, and I click open preview, I can do the same thing here. It's opened this page and it's redirected to that. And now I have my preview mode set, which I already did. But if I were to add some gibberish here, and I were to wait for that to save, I'll go back over here and I'll reload. And there it is. So this is really neat. It just makes it really easy. Let's publish that and go back. I don't know why I did that. I didn't need to, but it makes it really nice and convenient for the editor to just kind of like pop over to that page. Okay. So I mentioned a secret key that you could do, and let's show that this is also recommended in the docs. But if we were to go to content preview here, let's reopen this. And here, let's add another parameter. So we have this product ID equals this, but let's make it to where they have to pass a secret as well. So we'll say secret equals, and we'll do super secret. You would want to probably create some sort of hash or something like that. Put that in here. And then we'll use the and to set another parameter, another query param. And now that we've saved that, what's going to happen is we are going to go back over to our API here, and we're going to put a little condition. So rather than making you wait for me to type it out, I'll just copy paste this over just so you can see it. So before we set preview data around here, what we want to do is we're going to make a little if statement that's like, let's check for secrets. So we're going to have to pull that off of query params, right? Secret, secret. We're going to do a secret and we're going to say, hey, if that's not equal to some sort of secret environment variable here, which we'll go make. Let's do that. And we'll say super secret, right? That's what we set it to. Go back to preview. And so we'll say, hey, if their secret that they passed in the query params, you know, if they don't have one or it doesn't equal it because this is an object, so it will be undefined otherwise, if it's not equal to this from our environment, or they didn't pass a slug at all. So if either of the params aren't there, let's give them a status 401, which is unauthorized, and then give them the message invalid token. Let's see that in action. Oops, I better save. So let's go back here and we'll go to API slash preview. Let's just pass nothing. See that? We get an invalid token here. And let's go back to the network tab and we'll see this 401. If we hover over that, does it tell us? Yeah, unauthorized. Cool. So now if we did, oh, let's do product ID again. Nope, sorry. We have some new credentials that you need. And so what you do need is you need secret. And let's try one more. Let's do wolf instead. Nope, that's invalid because it's checked it. What about super secret? I did secrete again. What's wrong with me? Cool. Slug is not defined. Oh gosh, I'm sorry. In my last one, I was using slug, but I feel like that didn't make much sense. So I changed it to product ID. These are good little errors to see along the way though. So I'm going to leave them in just because one, you know that I can bleed, but also it's really just, you know, it's the everyday life of a developer. Why try to hide it? Right. And you get to kind of see like what happens if you don't have a slug. So let's do it again. Super secret. Hit this. Boom. Perfect. So we've got that all working. Lovely. So what we'll do just to finalize that, just to be sure, is we'll go to application. We'll clear this cookie just to make sure that we're in regular mode. And here, now that we've set this up with our super secret and all that stuff, let's go back to a content type and we'll go to our content type. And if we did this right, we shouldn't get an unauthorized when we click this. Invalid token. Ah, well, I like, I'm glad that we were really getting to see all of the layers here because I made some new mistakes. We did. I don't know why I was so obsessed with typing secret, but that's cool. So you can see it wouldn't work if we didn't do it right. We'll click this again and you know, there you go. It's like TDD, you know, let's take the unhappy path and then the happy path. Make sure that it actually breaks first. Good to have that assurance. Okay. Now as a regular user, how am I going to get out of this dang preview mode? Like we, you know, as developers might know to go to this application tab and we're going to go to this preview mode. And we're going to go to this preview mode and we're going to go to this preview mode. Like we, you know, as developers might know to go to this application tab or whatever, get rid of our cookies. But one, we don't want to have to do that all the time. And to our users, you know, we shouldn't expect them to know that. So what we're going to do is we're going to create a separate route to clear the preview data, the cookie, and then we'll make a little banner that lets you know that you're in preview mode, which will be kind of cool. And it'll also have a button to go to that route. So let's do that real fast. Go back to here. And in our API folder, let's make a new one. And let's call this like cancel preview. Maybe I guess we should probably do hyphens. And I'll just paste this here. So this is just a function handler. We aren't using rec, we are using res, we're going to call clear preview data. And then we're going to redirect them to the homepage because why not, we could like figure out what page they are and all that stuff. But let's make it simple for now. So let's quickly test that that works. We did cancel preview. And so right now we go to this, we should see our draft stuff. But if we were to go to the route API slash cancel preview, it should redirect them to the homepage, it cleared the cookie. And then if we go back, we can see that we're out of preview mode. Perfect. All right. So now I'm going to add a component here. So I'm going to since we don't really have a components, I like to make a components folder at the root, pretty common convention, do everything in the root next JS. So I'll do components here. And then let's make this like preview mode dot JSX or j, are we just doing JS, we're doing JS in this one. Doesn't really matter. And to save you time, I'm going to paste one that I've made. And I know you'd love to watch me type out all these styles. So you know, it's going to be a style thing, you'll see how it's styled. But really, it's this preview banner. Let's actually call it preview banner. I like that name better. Rename banner. So we have this preview banner, we're importing link from next link, so that we're using it properly. We have a span here that just going to tell them that it's preview mode. And in particular, this is the part we care about, we're using a link you this is important, you have to set this pre fetch false, because this is a link to an API route. It's in the documentation. If you look in the like next preview docs or anything like that, they have a little hint here. But just so you know, you want to set preview or pre fetch to false that when it's loading, and it's like pre fetching all of the single page app links that it doesn't do this one in particular, because it's not it's not an actual page, it's a route. And then I had to sable preview, but let's I called it cancel preview in this one. So let's do that. So we're we're redirecting them to this cancel preview, which will then clear their cookies and redirect them to home. And that's pretty much it. It's very simple. As far as this component is concerned, there's not a whole lot going on here. And it'll be in the repo if you want to reference it. Now next, what we want to do is we want to go to our slug page here, we're only going to show this on the on the product slug here, we essentially want to have like a prop stop preview, or something like that. So what we would do is we would go down to get static props. And you'll notice that we had this like context dot preview to determine this, which of course, you could destructure if you want to. But we'll say, hey, props, let's add a new prop called preview here to pass along and get static props. And we'll say, well, that's going to be equal to context dot preview. And so you might think that you could just do this. Unfortunately, I think this comes through as undefined. Let's just double check that. Come back here. So if we're not in preview mode, when we load this, yeah, we'll get an error because it's like error serializing dot preview return from get static props. So what that's saying, you always have to, you can't just have undefined, you can do null. But whenever you have something that's going to be undefined, you have to have another state of like, if it's undefined, we'll set it to false. Okay. I wish that they like it's a Boolean that comes in as true. So I wish they would automatically flag it as false, but whatever. So we'll say or false. So for in preview mode, set it to true, otherwise set it to false. Okay, then up here in our props, we're going to have access to that now. So let's do something like this. Let's say when you return this, you know, this is the error version. So we won't do it there. But here, we could do something like props dot preview, if that's true, and and load preview banner. I think that should be it. So we'll save that. Notice that auto imported that don't miss that. No, if it didn't do that for you, you need to import it, then we'll come over to here. Let's see if I did that. Right. So if you reload this, we shouldn't see it because we are not in preview mode. But if we were to let's actually just use our handy contentful link, we'll click that boom, boom, boom, this is what it would be for a regular content editor. Now they have preview mode enabled and it's got draft stuff. Pretty sick, huh? And then we could just click this exit preview mode, and it will clear that for them. And then of course, they would have to go back to the page, which is, you know, a minor inconvenience. But if you want to figure out how you want to redirect them properly, go ahead and do that. Okay, so we're really just about done now. I think that the last thing we want to do is add one more little security measure. I mentioned that in the docs, we were going to kind of get to some some extra little security stuff that they're kind of doing here. It's a minor thing, but it is minor for us to implement and you know, a good amount of extra security can't too much. So we have this thing right here, we're just like, hey, you know, if they don't have the correct secret key or the product ID, you know, go ahead and bounce them, otherwise set preview data. But really, what I would like to do is actually go and hit contemptful and make sure that this record exists. If someone's trying to get to the preview data of this thing, for whatever reason, let's go see if it's actually there. And let's redirect them to that product ID rather than use their query param. This will make it even safer with the rest are redirect. So as an example, we could go over to this like slug thing here. And what we essentially want to do is something like this, we would just take this like const product here we could this is from get static props in our slug, we could just take that. And we could say, hey, if they pass that first check, let's go ahead and fetch this thing. Now, we need to set our function to async. So let's do that. So that we can do that very easy. And now we can await this product. And so what we'll need to do, though, is we'll need to get client, right. So we'll import star as contemptful just to keep the same convention from and this is from our utils folder. Oh, it's just up one folder dot slash product dot slash I got lost utils slash contemptful. Sorry. Now we've imported it as contemptful. And now this will do contemptful. Client, we don't really need to do preview mode for this unless of course you wanted to, you know, also get URLs that haven't been published at all yet. That's a whole separate thing that I'm not going to do in this video. But what we can do now is we can check if this thing is here. Now, what's interesting about this is we want to do if you know, like there's no product, right. But what the contemptful reply comes back as for this get entries is going to be an array. And what we're really looking for is that array will have some metadata on it. And we've seen that in the previous videos. But in particular, the shape is going to be product items. And in this case, I'm going to use dot length because the items array will be empty if there are no records that match that. So we're doing a limited one, we're getting a product review type, we'll say, hey, it's equal to context dot params dot product. Oh, actually, we pulled that off though, right? Can we just do product ID here, because we copied it over from the other one, right? And so now we'll say, okay, the fields dot product ID is equal to the product ID that they passed in, go ahead and try to fetch that. If that comes back as an empty array, just bounce them again.", "name": "nextjs-contentful-preview.txt", "vector": [0.017386866733431816, 0.0011036983923986554, -0.005742295179516077,

invalid token, we'll do something like invalid product ID, whatever, you know, message you want to put there. Okay, so finally, what we'll do is now just to kind of make this a little shorter and more readable code as well. Or not not to have so much down here, let's go and get that field. So we got, we can assume that if they got past this, we have a product, right? And we'll say, page fields is equal to and what we'll do is product dot items. And then we'll do at position zero dot fields. And so we'll say that's our page fields or whatever, you could do this multitude of ways. And then we'll say page fields dot product ID down here. So what we've just done is instead of using the product ID that they passed in, and just kind of trusting it as, you know, the actual link that we want to send them to, we'll say, you know what, okay, you pass the secret, you've passed in a product ID, your secrets good. Okay, well, let me hit Contentful, let me make sure that that entry exists. If that entry does not exist, I'm going to bounce you again, you're unauthorized. But if it does exist, I will go and I'll get the field of product ID from that actual record, not the one you pass me in. And I will redirect you to that. So now let's test that out. And we'll be good. So if we come over to here, in our browser, we'll go back. And we'll say, Hey, you know, let's hit API slash preview. And this whole thing again, do I already have my stuff all saved? Cool. Whoops. Yeah, I do want this one. So we've got this long token here secret, this might be hard for you to read. I'm sorry, I can't like zoom in the URL preview equals secret. Secret equals super secret and product. So let's do product like 37. Right? If we do that, we should get bounced for invalid product ID. But if we change that back to product one, it should be good. And preview mode is now enabled. Pretty cool, huh? So let's make sure that still works with this link. Of course, we'd open preview. And you know, our users are still good. Well, I think that that will wrap this one up here. As usual, I hope that that was useful for you. I really hope that stepping through this, you know, piece by piece and walking through and explaining everything was useful for you, as opposed to just, you know, a lot of times just going through the docs and just kind of like speed running it, you know, might give you the answer quicker, but not really tell you the whys and the particulars and might leave certain things out. So, you know, please let me know if you appreciated that or not. And I will do my best to improve upon that. But regardless, I hope to see you in the next video, and good luck to you.", "name": "nextjs-contentful-preview.txt", "vector": [-0.005135310348123312, 0.01160344947129488, -0.007356691174209118,

I'm Jimmy Cleveland, and the goal of this video is to get some data from a headless CMS into our Next.js site. The headless CMS that we're going to be using is called Contentful, and I've chosen that because I have a fair amount of experience with it, and I've seen it growing in popularity, especially in the enterprise sector, where more and more companies are starting to adopt it. So I do think it's a good tool to have in your tool belt, but I do recommend learning multiple content management systems since it is a rapidly growing tech trend. It's just good to have a general familiarity with how these systems work. Keep in mind that that doesn't mean that this is my favorite CMS, it's just a generally solid one that a lot of people like, so I've chosen for this video. For the Contentful setup, I will be creating a new account, just so you can follow along with me and see what it's like to create a Contentful space, as they call it, create your first content type and content entry. And I'll be explaining some things along the way, whatever is necessary to get our minimum viable setup going for consuming that data in Next.js, but I won't be going over every little detail of Contentful in this video, just so you're aware. I'm assuming most people clicking on this video will be familiar with Next.js, which is what we'll be using as our JavaScript slash React framework of choice for this video. So while I will be walking through each of my steps so you can follow along, even if you're not very familiar with Next.js, I do think it'll be easier if you have a general familiarity of the basics of it and what it does, and of course with React and JavaScript. I won't be going into what exactly is static site generation and what's server-side rendering, or even why should you choose a headless CMS over other content management systems. It would just lengthen the video too much, and so I'm trying to keep this to sort of a minimal setup, where I do spend some time walking through, you know, what is Contentful and how to set that up, and what are some of the steps of Next.js. But our primary goal is just to get those two things hooked up and generating out pages with minimal setup. So feel free to use the timestamps if you have a specific thing that you're looking for. One last note is that I do plan on making some videos in the near future of some additional features of this particular setup, such as preview mode using Contentful and Next.js, as well as dynamically generating out pages by a slugger ID. And now that you know what you're in for, let's get into the code. I'm going to kick us off here by creating the Next.js project. So you can do that by doing npx create next app, and then at latest is usually what they recommend. I'll press enter here. And we can name this whatever we want. So we'll call it Next.js Contentful site. And then depending on your connection and everything, it'll take a little bit to run this. You can see it's installing React, React DOM and Next, and then for dev dependencies, ESLint and such. Now, just so you know, I'm on Node version 16.14.0, in case you want to follow along and you have any issues or anything like that during installation process, you might want to be on the same one that I'm on. But it should be fine on many other versions. So now what we want to do is go into this directory that they've just created for us. And I'm going to open it in my code editor of choice, VS Code for now. And as that's open, what I'm going to do is I'm going to flip back to the terminal and I'm going to start this by running npm run dev. Now, you can find all that out by going to here. Let's see, the docs for Next.js. You can go to docs and I'll link this in the YouTube video, but you can just search Next.js on Google. Scroll down here in the getting started and here's that command we ran. And you could also use yarn and we could have done TypeScript, but I want to keep it as simple as possible for people following along. Scrolling down here, you'll see that here's the scripts that we're going to take a look at in a moment that you could run. And even down further, this is just a basic example of like the simplest component that you can export here. So let's go back to our code. We look at our code, we go to package.json. Here's the packages that are installed. And so also if you're following along and you have any issues or whatever, you might want to try to make sure that you're on the same version that I'm on, 12.1.0 for Next, and that will subsequently install these. We also have these scripts here and that's what we're running right now is dev. So if we go to pages, this is the way that Next.js works. When you create a file in pages, whatever you name it is going to be the path. So you can do product1.js here, just right in the root of pages. And just so you can see real quick, this is our index.js. So that's like our homepage, pretty standard format there. And they came with a bunch of like code already set up for us, which we're going to see, but we want to create this product1 page. So the minimum thing to do that is to do export default, it has to be a default export, and then do function, and we can name this whatever we like. So I'm going to name it product page. I really recommend naming it and not doing an anonymous function because it will show up in the stack trace. Instead of being anonymous, you'll have product page, so it'll help you get to an error quicker. Then just like a regular React component, we'll just return some JSX here. We'll say hard coded heading. And then let's go back to our server that we started up and running that went on localhost 3000. And here we are, here's that homepage I was talking about with all that code they started us with. This is pretty standard, nothing crazy, but it's nice. It points you to where you can kind of start editing stuff. We want to go to the page that we just created, which is slash product1. Okay, so we have our server, here's our homepage, here's our product1 page that we just created. It does have hot reloading, which is really cool. I'll just show you that real quick, so if I were to change this to hard coded h1 or something like that, if I flip back over, it's instantly changed. You know, nothing crazy there, it's just, you know, hot reloading is pretty nice. It's a nice time to be a developer. So next what we want to do is kind of scaffold this out. So what I'm going to show you is there's this method you can go to in the docs called getStaticProps. And this is pretty much the, I would call it the default method of what you should be using if you are doing any sort of static generation or you're just kind of doing a lot of static generation. Static generation or server generation, because there's also a couple, like there's this getServerSideProps that you can use as well. So let me really briefly kind of go over the difference between these. So one of them is using static site generation, which is just doing it all, building all the pages ahead at build time. Okay, this is usually what you want to use because it's going to be the fastest for your users. You're going to incur a little bit of a penalty on build time. You won't notice it much until you start doing some pretty advanced stuff, you know, much larger scale. But the getServerSideProps is also really fast. And it's a good alternative when you need to do something dynamically, like you want to know what your user's location is or what their device is or something like that. That's the time where you kind of opt into server side props. There's other times too, I'm glossing over it. I just want to give you a quick overhead that there's these couple different methods that you might use. And how you would use that, you can see, let's actually just copy this. As you go back over to your code and on any page, it's kind of cool, you can opt in to this behavior. So normally it's just kind of like, you could think of this like createReactApp or something like that, it's just a regular component. But then we can do this export any function. I'll leave off async for now, actually. Normally you would do an async function, but I'll just leave it like this just so you can see. We'll clean up all of the clutter. And this will essentially just make it work. Let's go back to our thing, server here, reload, and it runs just fine, right? Now, let me show you when it doesn't run fine. So let's say we didn't put that, we just exported the function. What's really nice is Next is going to let you know, hey, getStaticProps function did not return an object. Okay, so they want you to return an object, and then subsequently they're going to tell you you need to return props with an object. So this name is important. Next.js is looking for this name specifically getStaticProps. And for our purposes, we're just doing this like one single page, pretend we're doing a product review website or something like that. So normally you might dynamically generate these all based on the slug or ID or something like that, but we're just going to keep it simple, minimum viable. We're going to set this up in such a way that we're just creating every page. We're kind of starting out and we're like, all right, we only have a few product pages, so we might as well just hard code those. So this could be whatever path you want and whatever name. And now how you get the data from this into this product page is through the regular props, just like a regular React method. So what are we going to want here? Well, we would want something like props.heading. So let's provide that for ourselves. We'll go to props and we'll say, oh, well, I want a heading here. And we'll just hard code it for now. Let's see, getStaticProps.heading. If we go back over to our site, we should be able to refresh. And there you go. We just get it. Now, if that seems a little pointless to you, well, right now it is. But what we are wanting to do here is this is a function that runs at build time. So you might be used to something like, if you're just doing a regular single page app with React, you might do use like useState plus useEffect here, and you'd do a fetch and you'd hit some API and then you'd render some data. That's all client side. And so the user has to wait for that after they've already downloaded the document and everything. This is doing this at build time. So we're going to get data from headless CMS here, or fetch an API or whatever. And that will run at build time and pre-generate all of that content out into the HTML so when they get the document, it's already built into the page. It's pretty cool. I'm not going to go into all the depth of showing that for here because the purpose of this is to hook up to Contentful. I'm just kind of trying to give a quick overview for those who aren't super familiar. So now that we have our kind of scaffold set up, we know what we want. Let's go to the Contentful website and set up our account. So we can go to Contentful.com here, and I'm going to do sign up for free. Now, this page is very corporate-y. It's very enterprise. You might be a little thrown off by the, they need a company and they want to work email. And if you go to sign up, it's all required, right? So don't worry about that. You can just use GitHub or Google, and they have a pretty generous free tier. You can totally use it just as a regular developer. I'm actually showing Contentful because it is, you know, appealing to a lot of enterprise companies right now. So it's a nice skill set for you to have, but you might also want to use it for just, you know, your own sake of knowledge, or maybe you're just dabbling with a bunch of CMS. So I'm not going to have you watch me fill this out. I'm just going to, you know, make an account real quick, and I'll skip ahead. But the one thing I do want you to choose is like, make sure you choose JavaScript as your development platform. That might matter. Job title, you don't have to worry about this. Just do other, and then maybe like developer job function, whatever you want there. Okay, I'll see you on the other side. Okay, I finished signing up, and it's just loading now. And then it jumps over to this tutorial, which is pretty cool. So kind of follow along with this on me. You could totally do it your own way if you want, but if you want to follow along, here's what we're doing. We're going to do don't know yet, so we don't have to answer anything. And then I'll do, I decided to use Contentful. These are the important options. We want to do that we're not at all familiar with anything, and that's because we want to go through their little tutorial. It's pretty neat. Okay, so here we are at the quick start guide. Now what we're wanting from this is essentially, it's going to walk us through creating our content model, a single content type, the entries on that, and then, well, yeah, an individual entry for that content type, the fields on that, that's what I meant. So a content model, what is that? You know, they have a quick little description here. It's essentially, you know, the schema for your database or something like that. It's how you're going to store all of your data and what you want the content structure to look like. It'll make some sense as we go, but that's kind of the overall database here for your CMS. So we have this editor view here that's showing this. It's a cool little diagram here where we have this news article. This is what we're going to look like when we're editing things. And that is rendered based on this right here, this news article content type. It has a heading field, a hero image field, and an author field, which you can see is a one-to-many relationship here. That's what it looks like anyways, of this author, also a content type. So these two different content types kind of drive this. So let's design our content model. Yep, we want to create our first content type, cool. And then here, I've already done a little dry run here. So you can see I've got some auto-filling, but this is a product review that we're going to make here. Make whatever you like, of course. And a brief description. I'll show you where this shows up for products. So this is just the content type. You can type whatever you want here for the description. When I create that, it's going to ask me to add my first field to it. So I'll add a field, and there's a bunch of different types. I'm actually going to go over some of these in future videos, but for now, we're just going to stick with text to keep it simple. We'll choose a heading. We'll choose short text, which don't worry about it saying exact search. There are different methods you can use to", "name": "nextjs-contentful-site.txt", "vector": [-0.0007730769575573504, 0.023762479424476624, 0.0024602909106761217, -0.011494912207126617,

It doesn't have to type it exactly. I'll show you that. But we're just going to call it heading. It'll automatically give you an ID, and we want to do create and configure. We could do create and come back later, but I just want to do it right now because I want to go over to the validation tab and pick required field. So I just want that to be required, nothing crazy. And then there's a default value, which is new, and that is very cool. I'm pretty excited about this, but we don't need it for this purpose right here. There's also an appearance. You can pick what you want the field to look like, which is pretty neat. You can embed it in a YouTube video or something like that, but we just want some help text here. So I just put, this will be the text for the H1 tag. I'll click confirm. And now I have my first product, and you can see here's that little description. So this is the first content type in our content model is a product review. If we click save, that will walk us over to, or actually it'll just save, sorry. It wants us to click content. So it takes us over to content when we click that. And this is normally where you'd add all of your entries. We have nothing yet, so we'll click this. And now we're going to create our first entry, which is like an individual instance of a content type. So we'll create and edit an entry. And all we have to do is fill this one field out that's required, and you can see here's our helper text. And I didn't really mention much about the helper text here. It's sort of implicit, but if you've never been in this situation before, this can be really nice if you have like content editors using this and they don't quite know what these fields map to on the website. It can be nice for little hints like that. At least that's what I use it for. So now the heading will put the very first product, bang, bang. And now as soon as it saves, it'll let us publish it. And now that is published for us to call from the SDK or an API. So let's go to Space Home. And that just took us right here, Space Home. And then here we've done our first couple of steps and they now want us to fetch content from the API, which is what we want, of course. They give us a space ID, content delivery token, and the actual entry ID, which is really nice of the thing that we just created. You'll see how we use this in just a moment. Come down here and it wants us to make our first request. I've actually tried this curl command and I couldn't get it to work. I tried messing with it in different ways and just never worked for me. So if you have that problem, don't worry about that. If you got it to work, then you're smarter than me. But go to JavaScript and there's a little guide that we're gonna follow here. With this JavaScript guide, you can just scroll down and it wants you to install Contentful. Let's just do that real quick. So go back to our terminal, we'll shut down our server and PMI Contentful. So that will default save it to our dependencies. Okay, we might as well start our server back up. Come back to the browser and you can see that we can just import it this way. Now we're using ES modules, so we might run into a little thing with that in just a moment. I'll kind of talk about that. But what we really want is this initialized client. So I'm gonna copy that for now. You can guess I could just click copy on. And I'll come over to here and let's see in our editor. So now what we want to do is we're gonna want to use this here. I'll explain that in a moment. But, or why we're doing it there. Let's say that we wanted to, they had this like var, Contentful equals required. This is just like normal JS, like you're using it as a script in the browser or whatever. And Contentful. So if we do that, let me show this. We can just log it right now, just to see. And I'll comment this out so we don't run into an issue with that. So I'll log this out so we can see if it's working or not. We'll go to our server. We have to actually refresh or like hit the server curl or something to get it. And let's see. Module not found, can't resolve content. Oh, I had a typo there. Contentful. Sorry about that. Okay, so it ran. And if we go to our server, we'll see right here, it logged it out. So it did work, but I actually don't want that. Why? Well, if you go back to index.js, you'll see that we're using ES modules as kind of our standard. And it's cool that that works, that we can do that. We can actually do that in conjunction with an import. So we could do import like link from next link. And this will work fine, but I just don't know what the ramifications are for that. And I don't really like mixing the imports here. It just gives me some concerns. So I was like, well, I'll do import contentful because usually if they support ES modules, you'd be able to do it this way. And they do say that they do. But what happens here is I'll get rid of that. And then I'll hit the page. So we're just gonna use an ES module version of it. Go back to the terminal, and you'll see that it says contentful undefined. That's really unfortunate, right? But let me show you how to deal with that. So what we can actually do, if you don't know any better, you could try and just do this star as contentful. And I'll kind of show you why that is. Let's refresh this, see if it works. And you can see it does work, right? That's pretty weird, huh? There are some docs that I did finally find that walked through that they wanted you to just do. This is an alternative you could do. Pull off this create client, sorry, method from. So you can always destruct like that. But how come the default didn't work? A lot of times when you use a library and you see the common just way to import it, which is like this var contentful or const contentful equals require, whenever you see the require syntax, you would think that you could just import this as default like we did before. So the reason that this is, is because sometimes when they support ES modules, they just kind of don't bundle it that way. They don't set it as the default. And so just a little troubleshooting tip here, you could go into node modules, it's going to get in the weeds here. But if you come down to the package contentful, what I'll do is I'll take a look at their package JSON. I'll be like, do you have a module type because webpack and some other bundlers will use that as a sort of flag that that's where the ES modules are. And they'll just continue to use main as like regular common JS. We do see that they have that. So we could go into their dist ES modules and it's telling us contentful JS. And in here, I'll just search for exports. And so with exports, you're commonly going to get this one because this is just part of the bundler, the exports ES module setting it to true. But then there's one more and it says exports dot create client. And that's the only one there is there's only these two. So we know that there's only this one export apparently. And whenever it's exports dot, that's going to put it on the exports object. So that's what's going on here. That's there's there's no default here. That's been set up. We just have this exports object. So we can import star which is like import the whole object and name it contentful. That's just the way that I like to do it. So I can kind of keep the same contentful dot create client syntax. Cool. So just a little tip there if you're you know, we're stuck in that land, can't find it in the docs or whatever. So I'm gonna get rid of all that. And we'll just use this syntax going forward. Import star is contentful. Alright, I'm happy now. So now we have this client. And we want to connect this up, right? So, hmm, okay, what do we do here? Well, we go back to this little tutorial here in our contentful. And they have given us nicely this space ID, I'll copy and paste that now this is public. It's perfectly fine for this to be known. In fact, it's right here in the URL bar. It's how you access it. I personally would still keep it secret because it's just another attack vector. But it's not the end of the world if you share this, however, access token. Don't share that. Make sure no one knows this. You can see mine right here, because I'm just gonna hard code it here just to get it running really quick. And some alarm bells should be going off for some of you, please don't do that. I'm gonna remove this space first of all for myself. But if you are following along here, do not commit this up, because this will be a headache for you. You'll essentially have to generate a new API token. It's not the end of the world. You can't really get it out of git history. It's kind of a nightmare to try. I've been in this situation before if you accidentally commit this up. So don't commit this right now. I will show you how to obfuscate this in a moment. For now, I'm just going to try and get this connecting, right? So we're all over the place, sorry. Now we're at this point where, okay, I'm getting the client, but why are we doing it here? You know, how would you know to even do it right here? Well, you can think of it this way. This git static props, right now it doesn't really matter. It's only going to run this one time because we have it on this one page. But if we were to do this dynamically, there's a time where we'll run this function for every single page that we're generating out. Anytime you're putting something in a function, just kind of expect it to be rerun. We don't want to recreate this client over and over. We kind of want the singleton behavior. So you could put this in another file. I'm just trying to co-locate everything or less fancy terms. Just put it all in the same file for now to keep it simple. But if we put it right here, it will just run as soon as this file is imported. So whenever Next.js uses this file, it'll run one time. And then everything in the scope of this file has access to that. Okay. That's just the way I prefer to do it. So now we'll have this client and let's go back to the docs and make it do something. If we go back here to this like JavaScript thing that we were following along on, I'll make sure to link these as well, both of these in the YouTube description. You can go to request a single entry. That sounds great. So let's copy that code, come back over to here, and we're going to run that right here. So we have the client. We'll call the client. We'll call client.getEntry, which is essentially a fetch here. And now we just need an entry ID. And then when it comes back, it's going to log these things out. So let's get that working. Go back to our space. And here's the entry ID. This is really nice of them to show you this. Okay. So we'll copy that. So this is for the very first product. It's the ID that we just created, or that it created for our product. And we'll paste that right here. We'll save that hard-coded. And then now we will hit our server. Boom. And go to our logs in our terminal. And here we go. Now you'll see that we got all this metadata for the first log, but then we got undefined. All right. So sort of so far so good. You can see that is our space and everything. But what we really want, you can see that it's a content type of product review. What we really want, sorry, is this right here. They gave us product name, and I didn't switch that to heading. So hopefully that's kind of making sense that what we're getting back is the entry that we created. There's some system data forward or metadata or whatever, but then field is really what we care about. Let's go back to that just to kind of cement that in your head. If you go to content here, these are all your content entries. And you click this one, and these are your fields. Okay. Or another way to look at it is go to the content model, click on the thing, and these are your fields. Okay. So we have a field of heading. Let's try and rerun that and see if we get it. Reload. And there we go. The very first product. Cool. So now all we have to do is pass that data along. Okay. So we can just pass that along to our component right here, product page, the way that we had already set up. But because we're in this promise, we actually would need to like, you know, we can't just return in this promise, essentially, we'd have to return the promise. But, and that will work fine. But I think it's a little more straightforward to do it this way. Because we're like, how do we get the data out of the promise after we're done? Well, we'll just set a sink here, like we originally had. And then what we can do is we can say const, let's call it product equals client dot get entry, you know, we don't even need any of this. We'll just fire this off. And whatever comes back will be the product that we get. And here we could do product dot fields dot heading. Oh, I didn't do a wait here. That's cool that they auto completed that for us. I actually want to do that up here. Sorry. That's kind of interesting. So I want to await this fetch and then move on to pass this into here. And this should just now work. Okay, our heading should change now. Reload the very first product. Cool. So we now we have a contemplable space with our first content type, and then pulling that data in to our next JS site and rendering it on the page. Pretty sweet, huh? So if we go back to Contentful, just in case you were following along, and for whatever reason, you didn't get these like home screens or whatever, all this stuff, let me show you how to get some of that information. So the first things first, you can go to your content entry, you can just go to content, click here. And if you click this info over here, that's where your ID for the entry is. Now a lot of times I won't be using this most of the time, because I'll be kind of just like going through a loop and generating them automatically. So I don't have to look them up by ID. But just in case you ever need to, this is where you get that information. Also, for the API keys, you can go to settings and API keys, and they just have this blank one like auto created for me. So I'll name this like next.js or something like what it's for. And then scroll down and here's your space ID. And here's your content delivery API access token and all that stuff. Okay, there's also a preview token, which is for like when stuff's in draft state, you want to publish it, I'm actually going to do a video on that too with next JS preview would be pretty cool, but I'm not going to go over it right now. That's for a future video. Okay, now I promised you that I would show you how to deal with this stuff. Okay, so we don't want this in here for when we commit our code up. So how do we obfuscate that? Well, the normal way is with an EMV file, you see, we don't have one by default. But if you go to their git ignore, this kind of clues you in, they have these dot EMV local development", "name": "nextjs-contentful-site.txt", "vector": [0.009737886488437653, 0.01142909750342369,

Okay, the quick overview of how next JS handles this is you could actually just use a dot EMV file, they'll read that as well. But dot EMV dot local is really what they're intending for any like secrets and stuff like that. That's because the regular dot EMV, we come back to that. The regular dot EMV dot development, not dot local, just dot EMV dot development is a file that you can use along with production to kind of put some defaults that your system will run on. And then you can have some very specific things that you want, especially like hidden secret keys and stuff like that API keys, you can do in dot local or the dot local versions of these. Sorry, if that's a little confusing, just for now. Usually you'll be fine. If you have any secrets, just storing it and dot EMV dot local. So Contentful, I'm going to name this Contentful space ID. And then I'll do Contentful access token. Those are the two that we need. I'll just copy these. So I've got the spelling right. And then here, what I can do is I'm going to copy this one to this one. And I'll copy this one to this one. Okay, so there's our file. And you can see it's not being tracked. It's gray here. So it's not wanting to track it. That's what we want. And then for these, we can just do process. This is just like node dot EMV dot, and then that name, this name right here. I'm making a mess of everything. Sorry. Same thing here. Replace this with process dot EMV dot. Put that there. Beautiful. So now let's make sure that when we refresh the page, everything's still working. Looks like I messed something up. Expected parameter access. Oh, you know what? I think we have to restart the server because we added some EMV files. So let's do that. Come back here. Refresh this. There we go. Very first product. Still working. Cool. So we have a really basic setup here, and we're pretty good. Let's just wrap this up by adding a couple more fields to make it a little more real here. So I'll go back to my Contentful instance. I go to content, and you can just discard those changes. We'll go into this. Actually, we're going to go to the model. But notice right here for the name, it says the very first product. It's by default using the heading. Okay, we're going to change that. So if we go into our content model, product review, we can now add a field. I'm going to add another text field, and we'll call this subheading. I'm just going to create it. No stipulations. And then we're going to add another field. It will also be a text field just to keep it simple. And we'll call this product ID. This one we are going to create and configure. We want to do a couple things here. We want to say this field represents the entry title. Sorry about that. So this will represent the entry title, and that's that name that it showed whenever you're looking it up. So this is the thing that we'll see as the default. So imagine that we kind of want to tie each of these review pages to a product ID to find it easy so we don't have to search by heading or whatever. Then we'll go to validation. We'll do required field and unique field. So we want, you know, it's an ID. We want it to be unique, and then we want it to be required. And that's pretty much it. We could do a placeholder or something like that, but I don't think we need to. You can rearrange these however you like. We'll click save. Then we'll go over to content. In the content, you'll notice that this is untitled now. That's because we haven't filled that out. So we added a field, so we can't publish until we add this required field here. So we'll call it product one. Then for the subheading, we'll do a cute subheading. Okay, so while we're here, let me show you the search thing I was mentioning. So one little quick pro tip here is you can, if you like wanted some extra fields to find, like, you know, say you've got a lot of different entries in here and you're trying to find one, you know, you could even have hundreds, you could click this little cog and come down and you can show whatever fields you want, which is very nice. So heading, we can do the very first, let me zoom that out just so you can see it. It's very first product. So you can see it. That's what it normally would look like. I'm just zoomed in to make it easier to read. Now, if we're searching for things, this is a little tricky because if you search for like, let's see, will it actually search by very first? Let's do first. Oh, that actually does work. It's like weird because it's wrapping. It's throwing me off. Okay, so if you're ever wanting to find something and you can't find it by a regular search, you can click filter and you can come down and you can filter by any type you want. So you could do heading and it says it is an exact match. So if you type a letter, it's not going to find anything. If you type even like first, it's not going to find anything. You'd have to type the exact, the very first heading or product. Bang, bang. Was that what it was? Yeah. And then it'll find it. But what we can do is we can change that to matches. This is what I was talking about earlier. You can make it a loose match here and then you can change it to a match. So if you're a loose match here and then you can just do like first, boom, it'll find it. Just another way to search through your stuff. Okay, let's bring that data in and wrap this up here. So coming back here to our product page, all we really need to do now is pass the rest of the thing. So what we're going to expect is let's wrap this real quick here. Let's do a div. I wish you would do that. Okay. Oh, I don't have formatting. Bleh. Okay. So we have a div, we have an H1. Now we're going to want an H2 with props.subheading. And let's console log props while we're here, just so we can see it in the actual page. So we're not passing that though, but we are getting it because we're getting the entire entry. So what we could do is we could pass the entire entry. So we could pass the entire entry. So what we could do here is instead we could change this to, okay, well, what if we just spread product.fields? Okay, because that's entry.fields or whatever. So all the properties that are on fields, we could just spread that into this object, or we could just assign, you know, whatever we want to the fields object since it is an object that's fine too. But let's just do that for now. Now, when we go back to our browser and refresh, we get it. Okay. And if we inspect, look in the console, you'll see this object, go away, that also has the product ID. So we've just effectively spread all of the fields just to kind of clean up the data for ourselves and give us all these different things that we can access. We're not even using product ID, but you know, they're all there at that point. You can do this however you like, massage the data however you like into the format that you want. You could also put this on like a product key or something like that, you know, some extra stuff, but we'll just leave it like this to keep it simple. So that'll wrap this whole process up. You know, I hope that that was useful as a kind of quick and dirty, this is how you set up Contentful and Next.js to get a sort of working product. Like I mentioned, I'm going to have some videos in the near future where I'll show some additional features such as preview or dynamically generating slugs and all that good stuff. But I kind of wanted to just get you up and running so you can see, you know, it's actually pretty simple once you know the right places to look to get this whole thing working. It's quite elegant. So I truly hope that video was helpful.

I'm Jimmy Cleveland and we're going to go through generating out dynamic routes in Next.js using some Contentful data. If you haven't watched the previous video yet, I highly recommend going back to that one which I'll have in the description. It'll be part of this whole playlist that we're doing of walking through and building up from scratch a Next.js plus Contentful site. However, if you're just here to see how dynamic routes work in Next.js and you want to hear me talk through the differences between get server-side props and get static props and setting up your get static paths and all that good stuff, then I think you should be fine just starting at this video. If you're unfamiliar with what dynamic routes means in this context, the quick version is that you can imagine that we have a series of pages or a collection of data or records that we want to generate out a bunch of pages for, rather than creating each of those pages one by one, you know, requesting the data for that or whatever we're doing. We essentially want to react to however many records we have, we want to loop over that data, and we want to build one page per each. And that does mean also generating out the route based on some sort of ID or slug or something like that. So that's why it's called dynamic routing, and I think the rest will make more sense as we jump into the code. Okay, so we're picking up where we left off from the last video in the series. I have the playlist in the description as well. And I'm going to be on a new branch here, dynamic slug. So I'm exactly the commit we were before, but I've made a new branch called dynamic slug. And I'm going to be using this pattern for each of the videos in this series. I think it's just the easiest to have one branch all in the same repo, one branch per video. That way at the end, the main branch will have, you know, the end of the project or wherever I've kept it most up to date. And then you can go to each individual branch for the end of each of the videos to see, you know, if you want to compare your code to mine. So to start this off, I'll just start up our server with npm run dev here. And we're going to open this in our browser and just see where it was where we left off. So we never touched the homepage, we are going to go to slash product one, and make sure that our content still rendering and it is so this is still coming from Contentful. And then here, let me show you in the code. We're on this product one page. So we have hard coded this page right now, or just made this file, I should say. And you scroll down here, and we're just getting the entry for a very specific ID, right. So the next thing that we're going to want to make this a little more real world is we're going to have multiple entries. In this case, we're kind of simulating we're doing product reviews. So we're going to have multiple pages of product reviews. And we're going to want to generate them all out. Now we could go through and make each file for each one, you know, in a really, really classic HTML way. So I can make a product two page, I can make a product three page. But then I have all this duplicate code that I've figured out how to abstract. And it's just kind of silly, when I could just fetch all of those entries and dynamically generate them all out as pages. And that's what we're going to do. So it'll probably make the most sense to go over to Contentful and make a couple of those pages. First, let's do that. So here in Contentful, in my space, we the only type we have is this product review. And so I'm going to do add product review. And that's on the content and go back here. So you click content in your space to go create some new entries. And here, what we'll do is we will have a new product. And we'll just say this is product two. We'll keep with the same convention. You know what, maybe I'll actually make something just so you can kind of see sort of dynamic difference. We'll make like XF Z dash 331. You know, let's just make up some like product ID here. Then I'm gonna make a heading. And so this will be the fantastic second product or something. Subheading does not matter. We're just going to fill all the things in. So we'll publish this. And now we're ready to fetch this. Okay, we'll go back to content. And you'll notice that when I made that one and backed out, it made an untitled draft. So I'm going to go back into that. And I'm going to finish that off. And we'll just make this one, you know, ABC 123. I don't know why I wouldn't just do that in the first place. Product number three. Okay. And woof. I don't know why. So now coming back to content, we have these three pieces. And you can see what's kind of cool is we can sort this by updated in case we ever want to see like, you know, if we or anyone else came in and updated this, what was the last change that happened? I do this a lot. I just pointing it out because I do this a lot when other people are editing a bunch of content and something for whatever reason, unfortunately, has an error that, you know, breaks the build, or you got something weird happening on the site, you can come in here and kind of see who did the most recent changes and go look at those articles and see if anything stands out. Now, I know these IDs are going to be hard for me to remember to test things out. So I might copy those over in a moment. But let's actually get some things working here. So we have these three product review pages. And we want to say, okay, I want you to go fetch those and build them out for me. And what I'm going to do, which might be a little weird at first, but I hope that it will kind of make the whole picture a little more clear by doing it this way, is I'm going to switch our get static props to get server side props. Okay, I'm going to explain why. So get server side props, just like that. You can also find that in the next js docs if you want. Now, as far as this is concerned, nothing should really change. Like if we go back to our website real quick, and reload the page it from our perspective, nothing's really different. Okay, the the thing that is happening different is that we are essentially generating this content out at request time, it's not going through and building up the pages out at build time ahead of time, and then you know, having them as a bunch of flat or static files, as they're commonly called. So we're behaving a lot more kind of like a traditional server here, except we are, you know, still generating out all of this, what normally would have been react client side code before, you know, into the document before we give it to the user. So we're doing this on request here. And the reason I'm doing this is because it's a little easier to set this up for multiple pages for a particular slug. And let me show you that. So if I rename this, and I promise I'll explain this and the when we transition back to get static props and why we're doing it and show some examples. So we can change the name of this, we had it as product one, right, we can change the name of this to brackets slug, this is a next JS convention. Now it does not have to be slug, I'll show that in a sec. So we will name that whatever we want. But it's a really common convention to name a slug. And if you're not familiar slugs, pretty much a common term for sort of like an ID, something that you throw on on the end of a URL. So for doing you know, whatever page we're on slash whatever. So in this case, this is saying any routes that since I have it in the root of pages, any routes after just the homepage route slash whatever, are going to resolve to this template. So let's test that out and see if that's actually working. So we go here and we refresh. And you'll notice that we do get that right product one, but we could actually type whatever we want here, we can type ABC, see it wasn't even one of the ones that I had, it's always going to return the same thing right now. So if I go back to product one, and then I go back to my code here, what I can do is there is an object here called context, you can name it whatever you want, of course, and we're gonna log that. Whoops, context. Probably should just put that in an object. But then what we'll do is we will hit our server. And we'll look at the actual server output. And you'll see that we get this big dump, right? So this first object has a ton of stuff on it. So if we go to here, it's even further up, sorry, lots and lots of data. And this is like a, this would probably be familiar to you if you've done some Express stuff before with the request object and all that stuff coming in. So you can see it's context, all this stuff comes in. And some of this is really, really useful. And this allows you to, you know, respond to let's say, like the user agent, if they're using Firefox, or whatever they're using, if you want to base it on like the type of device they're using and their location, all that type of stuff. We're gonna keep it pretty simple here. What we're particularly looking for is going to be down here, I think at the bottom. And you'll notice there's this params property. That's what we're interested in. And it is very similar to query, but query will have additional stuff like what's on the query string. Whenever we pass, you know, slash whatever, and it's going to come in in our params object as whatever we named that little file. So let's go back to our code. And we can just simply log out context.params.slug. Okay. In fact, I'll just log out params from this point on just to show up for there. And so all we need to do now is figure out, okay, so whatever the user typed in, that's what we want to go and request, right, like that product ID. And it will just to show you if I rename this real quick, I'll name this to, you know, I'll rename this to, you know, I'll rename this to, I don't know, we used wolf earlier, so let's just use wolf. And then we'll hit our page again, go to our server. And then you'll see that params object here is going to be wolf. Okay. So we do have to match it, I'm going to change it back to slug. We do have to match it to whatever we named this file. And since I'm editing this currently, it would probably make a lot more sense if this file resided in a like slash product slash whatever the ID is, right. So we'll create a new folder, we'll call that product, new product or plural products, whatever format you want, move that file into there. And now what's going to happen is when I refresh this, this is no longer a valid route, because I need to type in product slash and then whatever we want. So product slash one or product slash product one, you know, whatever the whatever the key is. Now, a quick note, I was going to leave this to a future video, and I'll cover it a little bit more later. But just in case, just so people don't get confused, you might see a format sometimes in the docs that's like dot dot dot slug, right, like brackets, or even double brackets. Okay, so what that is, essentially, let me give you an example, just so you know, is that if the limitation here is that if you do product one, that works fine. But if you did product one slash two or slash whatever, that doesn't work. So our bracket slug is only catching this first param here. But we would do the dot dot dot if we wanted to catch multiple paths. And there's a lot of different reasons why you might want to do that I'm not going to get into right now, like maybe you're doing some sort of crud or whatever model where you know you want to have you're fetching the thing for an ID, but you have like an edit view or a show details view, you know, the read view. And there's other reasons as well, you can kind of come up with all sorts of different paradigms that are pretty common for that. But a really common simple format is just to use this bracket slug. So we're going to keep it simple like that for now. Okay, so now what's really left to do is to go get that content by the ID that we're requesting, right before we switch it back over to get static props. And I'll show you how to do that. So we go back into our browser, I have these docs up earlier, and these will be in the description if you want to go find them. But there is these there are these using JS CDA SDK. So using the JavaScript SDK for Contentful docs, and we had previously used this get entry to get a single entry. So if you scroll down a little bit, there's some more about get entries. And they do talk a little bit about it, how you would do pagination, there's some useful things here. But in particular, probably the close, let's find the closest that we want, we want to get something by content type, this is a really common way to use this and how I usually do it. So I'm going to copy this part, I don't need that that after part, come back into here. And for this client dot get entry, instead, we're going to do you know, I actually got rid of all of that client dot get and trees. And that takes an object of options here. And you can do by product type. So how do we know our product type? Well, if we go back to Contentful, and we go to our content model, you can click this. And you can see right here, this is the content type ID. And that's in particular what we want. So we'll just paste that here. It's a string. And now we're going to get entries for that. So let's look what that returns with that, you know, this is going to break. But for now, let's just do product. And this is actually products in this case, but let's do that. We'll call it product. I'll just leave that for now. And we should still even though it breaks, we should still get a response here. So we refresh this, we should get an error, I think, oh, actually, we just get nothing. Let's go back to our server and see what we got here. Okay, so we did for the context, we got the slug of one, we just went and got all products, we didn't look up that particular one. And you'll see we get some data back, it says we got three entries, and we do have three total. So it did get all entries. The skip, that's just when you're doing pagination, it's limited to 100 at a time. And then you can see items. So items is usually where it comes back on. And so that's how we would get all of those things. So of course, like we could go and get all the entries. And then we could just, you know, search through them for the ID that we're looking for. But a better way to do this is actually to to do this, you can throw another property on here, it's a string. And that's fields and dot, and then whatever the field is, in this case, it's product ID. And then that's going to be equal to let's just set it to product one for now, just to make sure that we get something. And let's see what we get. So we come back here, and we'll refresh. And this is still not going to work,", "name": "nextjs-contentful-dynamic-routing.txt", "vector": [0.0036146657075732946, 0.015426157042384148, -0.008694009855389595, -0.0011203447356820107,

But here, we should see products, notice, we only got one here this time. And we have then there's that array. Okay, now really quick, how we would know that we were using product ID, well, you could go back to your your thing individually. And you could look at whatever you're trying to grab it by, in this case, we want it by this ID. And so you can enter, you can click settings for that. And it's right here, this field ID. And I have tried this, just so you know, to write this as an object instead of the string, and it doesn't work. So you do have to write it this way. So it's always fields. And then it's whatever your field is, this might seem a little weird to you. At first, it was a little weird to me that we're kind of getting entries instead of having a get entry method for a particular type of field. But that's just the way that there's works. I haven't found a way to do it with get entries. I've been looking at the signature. And it looks like it still just takes the product ID requires that and then whatever options you want. And I've seen it in some docs somewhere, I just couldn't locate it to link it to you, that this is a potential way to do it. One thing you could do as well, as you could look into their, I'll probably link this as well, their content delivery API, this is like the generic docs for their, their whole API, not just the JavaScript one. And the SDK that we're using is just a wrapper over their restful API. So you can come in here, it's really nice docs, they will see if we could, I'll do like fields dot, you can see this down here, they have these sort of examples, it doesn't quite give us exactly what we want. It tells us some common fields and stuff like that. I just couldn't find the spot where I had found that before. But if you look up this, like, get single asset type, you can sort it by, you know, different, you know, select your platform for generic stuff, you can see all the parameters that you can pass. So you might want to just dig through here and kind of see, you know, what are some common things to pass to it. But this is the way that I do it. So you know, if you just want to follow along here, you can just stick to this format, you will still get an array back. But that's also the way they do it with GraphQL. But their API, you also still do a get all of the collection, and then you just put like a limit one, and, you know, filter by the ID and all that type of stuff. In fact, you'd probably want to throw limit one on here, I might move this up. Because just in case there's duplicates or whatever, you still only want one entry back, right? It should never be duplicated, because it's a unique field, but a unique field. But just to be sure. So now what we really want here is we get this product back. And what we're going to want to do is return. So we'd say, okay, well, I'll do product at zero, it's actually dot items, if you remember, at zero, and then dot fields. And this should still kind of work. It's a little dangerous way to do it. But let's try it. There we go. Okay, so it is working, we are, you know, hard requesting that one. But this is a different way to fetch that same one. If we go back into here, we can see that we do have our limit one here. And we have this items that we're pulling that off. And so items is going to have all the different types of that content type, I think you get it. Okay, well, let's actually change that, right, to be realistic here. So we go back to our code, let's take that context dot params and use that slug. So for here, for product one, we use context dot params dot slug. And of course, you could destruct this or whatever. I'm just leaving it here because I think it's a little more transparent when you're just barely learning it. But if you want to clean it up, go ahead. We'll kill that. And we'll still log out the product just to see. And then we'll go back here. And we'll refresh. And we'll see that we get an error, right. And this is because it doesn't actually exist. Let's make sure it works with the happy path first. So let's do product one. And it does work. Okay. And if we go to let's do one of our other types. So we had content and we had this ABC 123. Well, that's an easy one to remember. So let's just do that. ABC 123. Boom. And there you can see that one working. So this is working. But we noticed a flaw here. What happens when we go to request a slug that we don't have? Well, we have a problem when it comes back. Okay, so there's a number of ways we can handle this. But you know, it's a little unrealistic for us to, you know, limit what you know, we go and fetch, we're still going to end up doing this little request here, because you know, it's constantly updating and we don't really want to maintain, you know, a matched list where we have to keep track of every little ID that's in our contentful thing. You know, that's just a disaster waiting to happen. So, you know, an easier way to do it is, let's hit it and request it. And when it comes back, let's check if it's even there. Okay. So what we could do is we actually could cheat and just do these little optional chain operators, which are cool. You can even do this with an array if you didn't know. And we can just do this all the way here. And just this seems like this would fail because it would spread on undefined, but actually won't do anything. You can see that right here. So we're re refresh that. And you'll see that we just get this empty page, right? Now that's not ideal, but at very least, it's not breaking. And does the, you know, correct one work? Yes, it does. Hmm. So what could we do to, you know, give the user a better feedback loop? Well, we could do something like, you know, let's put an error on the object if we have one. And we could say, okay, well, if there's not product.items.length, and I happen to know that you just get an empty array back, by the way, if you don't, but you could check that yourself. You get an empty array back if it doesn't exist. So if that doesn't have a length, you can do an and and here. And then we'll just type some message like, let's actually interpolate it. And we'll say no item or no product with ID. And then we'll do context.params.slug. Okay, now I'm going to wrap this here, just to make it a little easier to read. And then, of course, we need to put a comma here. All right. And so now what's going to happen is this going to come back false. If we, you know, did have a item come back, because it'll check the length. And otherwise, it'll come back with the string. And so what that will allow us to do is we could just check our props here. And we could do, you know, something simple like if props.error. Okay, we'll return just a simple thing here, we'll do an h1. And we'll say an error occurred. And then h2. And then we'll actually print out the error. Okay. So if we get an error, let's print them something some different render. And otherwise, we'll just continue on. You could, you know, clean this up and abstract it however you want. And it is a pretty simple primitive way to do it. I'm just giving you kind of an example. So we could refresh this, this will still work. If you type another thing, it'll be like an error occurred, no product with ID ABC 123. If we go back to our terminal, we'll see that when we got back products, we'll see that here's this items with an empty array. And that's what we were checking against. Okay, so that's just a really simple quick way to have a fallback while using server side rendering. And when the user is requesting something that doesn't quite exist. Of course, there are a multitude of ways that you could handle that. But I'll leave that up to you and the concerns of your app. So now what we've been building up toward is we want to use get static props, because we actually want to render this ahead of time. Okay. So why I went through all this, you'll see right now, when I save this, I just flip it over to get static props. And I go back and I'm going to make a request here, we're going to get an error that says get static pass is required for dynamic SSG pages get static pass, that's a new one. So when we're static generating pages, and saying it's missing for this, you know, path that we made, and they give us some docs here to check, right. So we can go over to the docs, and they will kind of clue us into here, what our particular issue is, but I'm just going to walk you through it. So what it is, is I did the get server side props first, because you can see that, when we are doing it server side, we're doing it on request, we can essentially respond to any of these IDs, we can say anything slash product, whatever the user types in whatever link they clicked, or whatever, however they got here, we want to go and request that particular ID. But how do we do that ahead of time? If we don't have anyone to go in and type those numbers or, you know, any requests coming in, how do we say, well, you need to build out all these pages, it has no way of knowing that, right? It doesn't know what all our product ideas are, or how many we have or anything. So what we need is this get static pass. This is kind of the mental model that helped me kind of figure this out why it was needed. So I hope that that explanation makes some sense to you. So what we're doing is we're now going to make a function export async function in the same file called get static paths. So you need this whenever you use get static props with dynamic generation, we didn't need it before, because we were just rendering out one thing. And next is smart enough to realize that and give us a nice error. So you can think of get static passes, the thing that runs when our build starts, it's going to go and for each of these paths that we give it, it's going to run this get static props on it. So what it expects here is we're going to return an object, and it's going to have paths on it as a key. And if you actually hover over this, you can see it does have, you know, it expects a promise back with paths of any I wish it showed more than that. But so we know that it wants paths back. And what it actually wants is an array of objects here. And that has a familiar signature of params. And in this case, whatever params we want to pass, so that we'll do like slug, and we can really pass any params we want here, it's the same as when we looked at the context params before. So we're kind of, you can think of it like we're simulating a user going through and passing in each of these things or clicking each of these links or whatever, making these requests. So for this first slug, let's do product one, okay. And then we just need to copy this. And we'll paste another. And I guess we'll just do we'll do all three here. This is ABC 123. And that it doesn't really matter the order per se. Yeah, we don't really care that as product 123 or whatever. I'm just hard coding it for now. Let me go get our other one, because I already forgot it. As I said, it would X F z 331. Okay. X, C 331. Okay, now that's almost it. So it's going to go through this array. And for each one of these, it's going to call our get static props with these params and that slug. And then you know, the rest of it's all wired up, it's going to go ahead and make that fetch per one, build out those pages ahead of time. Now there's one more thing that's required here. And you have to have a fallback key. And it would have given me an error if I tried to go ahead for that. They're really good about that. Now fallback, we're just going to do false. And I will briefly explain that after we see if this works or not. So we're gonna come back out here, and I'm gonna do npm run build just so you can kind of see it happen. Okay, so finished up, you let's check our logs first. So you can see that we got these products. Let's see. So for the first one, the error was false. We got this data. Same thing here. So we got the very first product. And then here, here's our other product. Cool. So we looks like we got each of them, the build was successful. And I wanted to point out this really nice little output that next JS gives you. So you have to see how they have this legend here. And it tells you that this static site generation, you know, using get static props is a filled in little dot. So you can see our 404 page is just regular static here. We have this sort of little lambda type thing, where it's slash API slash Hello, that's just our API route. And you can see that's a server one. Our homepage is also simple static. You know, that's just saying that we just wrote the code, we're not doing any sort of dynamic generation thing. But then here, everything under product and even prints out the ones that we made are all under this SSG using get set of props, right? So that's pretty cool. What if just to kind of see the output real quick, before I load it up? What if we were to just do get server? Oops. Side props, I moved my hand and messed me all up. I'm going to comment this out just in case. I don't know if I'll be mad or not. And we go and we rerun that build, we should see that we should have that little symbol here for Yep, product slug. See, it doesn't even bother printing them out, because it doesn't know ahead of time what they're going to be. You can request any ones you want. It's dynamic. So that'd be requesting it from the server, right? Okay, so let's go back one step, switch this back to get static props. And let's actually see it working. Now I could just start up my server here, but I'm going to do npm run and start up the one that I had built for production. I mean, let's come back to this. We'll refresh the page. If it's done, is it done? Oh, oops, that's the bad one. Okay, so here, we've got that. And then we've got one, or is it product one, right? Okay, and it's all working. So that was statically generating it. So there's the trade off, right? Like, you know, time to first bite and all that's going to be a little bit worse with server side rendering. But we have less build time to do it that way, because we're waiting for the user to request it. So it's a little bit slower for them. It kind of depends on your use case, if it's noticeable or not. At scale, it can be very noticeable, if you have a lot of things going on. But we're using static generation, which is basically what they recommend for Next.js if you don't have any need to do it on request. So we're going to incur sort of the penalty for the users, you know, we're going to take the blow for them. Our build is going to take a little bit longer, because we have to build those out ahead of time. But they're going to get a better experience overall. Those are the trade offs that you have to decide when you're choosing between these things. Now, you might have noticed that if I typed a bad product ID, I just got a", "name": "nextjs-contentful-dynamic-routing.txt", "vector": [0.011084523051977158, 0.011077873408794403,

Okay. And so that's what we wanted. And that's what this fallback false does. And you have to choose this, it's required, these are the two things fallback and then pass. Okay. So the fallback, I said I was going to explain this. So what it is, is when you set this to true, it is setting a fallback and you'll you can kind of see it right here. If I were to refresh this, notice that we got that little error occurred thing. So that's how we could sort of still have this behavior where we static generate out the pages that we told it to. But if they want to request something that we haven't static generated out, it's still going to let it through, you can think of it that way, and do our normal flow and kind of render it as a server request, basically, it's still going to try to statically generate it for future use. But the reason that you would want to do fallback true, which you can look up in the docs if you want to read about it a little bit more. But the quick and dirty is, if you have a ton of things that you're rendering, that's a really common use case where you really don't want to wait for this gigantic, you know, multi 1000 page build, you might but a lot of the times you won't. And so what you can do is you can use fallback true to essentially say, Okay, well, I want to generate out the first like 100 pages, because those are important to me, or maybe I'll pick and choose which ones are really important and put them in my little array that I pass and get static paths. And then if the user ever requests one of these other ones, and they exist, like go ahead and and build that statically for future users, but don't build it in the initial build. This gets a little bit too much into the weeds, and I'm not going to go too much further. But there is also like incremental static regeneration, which is another cool feature the next 12 has, you don't really need to worry about these things. When you first start out, those are things that will give you some cool solutions to some problems you might have down the road. But when you're just starting out, you can be pretty solid. Just using fallback false is what I would recommend until you, you know, need fallback true. That's my personal preference. If you have a, you know, a small amount of pages starting out, start out with fallback false, you know, come back to it and read a little bit more about it and build up the complexity of your app when you actually need it. So for now, we're just going to say, hey, if you hit any, you know, product that we don't have, we're just going to 404 you. Okay, we're almost done with this one. There's just one last thing. We hard coded these. And like I said, we don't want to maintain this list of all these different slugs. So what we want to do is do this get entries request here. We're going to strip it down a little bit. And we'll say, you know, products in this case, because it's going to be products. And we're going to do still by content type, but we're not going to do a limit or anything. We want to get all of them. Then when we get products back, what we could do here, and I'll do it outside of the object. It's really common to do it in it into the return object, but I'll just do it here to make it sense. So I'll do const paths, let's call it equals. And so we're going to take this products that comes back. And remember that products has items on it. You can look it up in the console if you want to check it out. And the items is an array. So we're going to map for that array. Okay. Now with that, we're going to say for each one of those, we have a product, we could call it an entry or whatever you want. It's really common to call it an entry since we did get entries, but I'm going to call it product. And for each product, I want to return an object. And what I'm doing is I'm making my object look like these objects so that I can simply return paths really simply. So I'm going to say for each product, I want you to return an object here. So we're going to have an array of objects that has params on it. And it has slug on it. And that slug is equal to product dot product ID. Okay, then we can replace paths here. And actually, we can just do comma. So you know, it'll be the the key is the same as the value. We can also do this inline down here, however you like, it's fine. And that's it. So now if we did this, right, let's actually, you know, run a build real quick. See it print them all out. Nope, no, I did something wrong. Let's log this out. Let's make sure that it's right. Let's do this on the fly here. So we'll say paths, paths. And we'll run build. Oh, slug is undefined. You know what, I know what I did wrong. It's product dot fields. Silly me. Product dot fields. I'm sorry about that. Cool. Okay, so that worked. So now we can, you know, just double check that we're good. We can have him run dev. And now we're requesting each of these things. And we don't have a product one, three, we have product one, though. And we could very simply to test this out. Let's go make another product. And we'll just do product for I know we're being silly here. The fourth product. We'll publish that. And then when we come back here to our dev server, actually, I didn't have to go to the code or anything like that. I should just be able to request product for now if we were statically building it, of course, we would have to build it out all over again. But with the dev server, it kind of live requests it. And there you go. So now you've seen how you can dynamically render these and you can do it server side or you can do with static generation for each product with whatever format that you want, whatever, you know, sort of path URL and slug ID, whatever you want to call it that you'd like. Now, I'll just give you a little hint of kind of the next thing that you normally might want to do. In this case, you're probably fine with product reviews just to have product and slug. But a lot of times you might have a, you know, slash product page, right? Without another slash and a URL slug, because that might be a sort of list of all of the articles or something like that. For that, all you need to do is get a new file and do index dot j s here, and then do your regular song and dance of next JS and put whatever you want there. So I'll leave that as a little challenge to you if you really want to do that. But you pretty much have all the code in here to point you in the right direction to pull that off. You just remember you don't need to do get static paths because it's just a single path. So you could just do it, get all entries, dump those out however you like. Just don't forget to use next link when you do it. You know, make sure that you look up in the docs next JS link. Make sure you look this guy up because you're going to still want that fast single page app behavior. But that's all I have for this video. Once again, I hope it has been useful, and I hope to see you in the next video where we continue to build on to this little project.", "name": "nextjs-contentful-dynamic-routing.txt", "vector":

Tonight we shall study the dark arts of necromancy. I often come across developers, whether they're experienced or newer in their careers, referring to their GitHub as a sort of graveyard for dead projects. They might not use GitHub, they might just be local projects or a different repository system, but regardless, the mood is still the same, even if they don't use those exact terms either. It's essentially, I don't finish a lot of projects that I work on, and it fills me with either persistent anxiety or anxiety at varying intervals. I think most of us can relate to this, and it certainly resonated with me when I first heard it from someone else. And it's not just a coding thing, the advice that I'm going to try and impart throughout this video is applicable to other areas of life for sure. That advice, put simply, is to embrace that graveyard, which I call coding like a necromancer. When I say embrace your graveyard of projects, it's not meant as an excuse to just not finish anything, because certainly there's a lot of value in finishing projects. In fact, a lot of the times for my projects, the last 20% of the project is actually like 50% of the work. But it is an excuse to let it go, especially if you're moving on to something else. Bad scientists and necromancers alike classically have many failed experiments before they have a success, and while it may be horrible and unethical when you're experimenting on bodies, it is not when you are experimenting on code. I myself, and I've seen this in others as well, what often sets me back the most in progressing, just in my everyday life, in my career, in the things that I want to do, is the anxiety that's caused by having all these things on my mind that I need to do or that I've never completed yet, and it's like, oh, you know, I should go back and work on this project or I should finish this project, I'd like to be done with it. What ends up happening from that is that I just don't end up doing anything at all some days. I just become overwhelmed from that. Instead, why not turn all those project corpses into fuel? Don't even give a second thought to those failed experiments, except for that you learned something from them. And now you have those discarded parts from those experiments as references for your new projects. What I mean by that, getting out of the analogy, is that you have all this code that you've worked on that's saved up to a repo, hopefully, it could be on your computer, but I hope you store it somewhere else, that you can constantly reference in anything new that you make because you're going to forget that stuff at some point or another. So you're building up this sort of library of mad scribbles that you're creating, whether some of them are successes and whether some of them are failures, it doesn't really matter because you can always continue to reference that code in the future, and that's useful in itself, aside from the fact that you clearly learned something when you were making that. And why I say embrace this graveyard, even though finishing something is very valuable, is starting over is also really valuable. Some of the best code that I've ever written is when I started over once or twice, and a lot of developers would love to be able to start a project over, but they just can't. They have to keep working in a quote-unquote legacy code base. Also, as I've observed at least, you usually have to build something wrong or incorrectly to really understand why the right way is the correct way. You'll constantly encounter tons of idioms and best practices throughout your programming career, and if you just follow those blindly, you won't really know why. And if you're like me, eventually those will pile up to where, you know, I just do this because they told me to, and that's the way it is. And you can only do so much of that before you just really don't know why you do anything, especially when someone questions you about it. So there's a lot of value in just failing, obviously. That's a common saying, and this is just another way of wording that or looking at that, I think. It's really good to create the problem and have the problem and then start over or just move on to something else. Really, my point is summed up that you learn something from that, and you should embrace that. So what coding like a necromancer means to me is treating every graveyard project in your GitHub or wherever you store it as a success. Start embracing that you just did a ton of stuff, that it doesn't matter if you finished it or not. You know, there are certain times where you want to try to push yourself to finish things, but if you're really just not feeling it, don't beat yourself up over it because there's really not much value in that. There's not much value in letting yourself get overwhelmed and just feeling bad about it or just not doing anything that day or letting it eat away at you. Look at it as all the code that you've written that you consistently are doing stuff, and eventually that's going to turn into something, a skill set, a successful project, something that you can be proud of, something that's a success. But honestly, from my perspective, it's all a success. If you're progressing, that's a success. I want to end this video by showing you a real-world, you know, personal project of mine where I've had this very same problem. It's called Parallax Fjord. It's this little project that I did, I think, about a year ago, and it's a real-world example of me never feeling accomplished, even though I should have been proud that I built this thing. Throughout the part of my career that was making websites, I always wanted to work on a parallax site. And a ton of people have done this, so it was always like a spot of sort of an embarrassment for me because I just really like animations, I like creating UI, and I just never got to do this. There was never a project that allowed me to do this. So what I set out to do was to learn how to create a parallax site, and I wanted to first try to use some frameworks or tools because I really didn't have any idea how to do it. I was like, maybe I could figure it out, but let's try to just, you know, use whatever's popular. And what I ended up doing was, as I just happened to be going through Svelte, the docs, there's a part in there where they do a cool little parallax effect, and it kind of clicked for me how easy it is to actually do this. And so, you know, we started with something that I didn't have a good mental model for how parallax really worked at all, and I started trying to use frameworks and tools, you know, as you usually do, but eventually I made my code much simpler, in my opinion, and much more understandable for me, which was the important part because I built a mental model of how to create a parallax effect. And there's varying different ones that you can create, of course. It's just the one that I made. And then I also really wanted to do like a cool sort of SVG scene where it, you know, goes under the ocean. It's not super creative or original, but I've always wanted to create something like that. I've always been inspired by those things. There was quite a bit of work that I had to figure out for, you know, how to actually output the SVGs and how to layer them, especially the clouds that kind of go off the screen and all that. And then to top it all off, I added this like tree animation that was actually really complex to, you know, make all the trees kind of sway in the breeze. I did end up having to use a library for that. And, you know, I figured out that it didn't look very lifelike when I did them all at once. So I made them like staggered. So I had to write this function to go over, you know, each of them and stagger them. And then I did it all in Svelte first, but then I actually was pretty crazy. And I went and I built it in React. And then I built it in Vue because, not that it was the most beautiful code for any of them, but I wanted to just kind of see like size comparisons for something silly like that and, you know, what all work it was. And I was just kind of looking to compare and contrast like a little niche kind of idea and which one I liked best. I was just experimenting with them all. So, you know, after a bunch of work put in of all, you know, I rebuilt this thing, you know, multiple times. To me, that should have felt like a huge success. But there's always something else, right? Like I got into this problem where like now I wanted to demo it a little bit and show some people that I knew, but I realized they'd be looking at it on their phones and I didn't build it for phone at first. I built it for desktop. And when I brought it down to a phone, I realized like all the dimensions were all wrong and the scrolling was very different and all that stuff. So, you know, I kind of just made it work, but I wasn't super happy with it. I was like, okay, at least it's supported on the phone, but I could say it's a lot better on desktop. So, you know, that's at least a stepping stone. But that was just one more anxiety that I felt of like, you know, I didn't really finish that. And then I realized that on little slower CPUs, the frame rates would get pretty messed up. I also at first had this like cool SVG distortion filter that I was playing around with to make the water kind of wavy in front of the SVGs. And it looked really cool, but it just destroyed the frame rate. And so I was just left with this project that I couldn't really demo or show because I wasn't proud of it because the frame rate was terrible and I hadn't optimized it and figured it out despite putting a bit of time into it. And that haunted me for like months. Every time I thought about it, I didn't think of it as like, oh, I learned all this cool stuff and I kind of finished this project. It was just like, oh, it's just another project that I didn't finish and I really need to go back and do it. So I think you get the point now. And what, you know, until I reflected on this idea of treating your projects as success, even when you don't finish them, I wasn't very proud of that. And all the work that I put in was just kind of thrown away and it actually ended up serving to just give me more anxiety. But after really thinking about that, you know, it put things into perspective and it helped me re-clarify and refocus like, yeah, I did that. And now I can do something cooler next time. So that real world example was just to kind of show you on a personal level that I feel this as well, just to give a little bit more context and especially for, you know, younger, newer developers, that, you know, people that have been doing it for many years feel the exact same thing all the time. It doesn't matter how good you get or how cool is something you make. If you let yourself, you'll be disappointed in it. You'll never really feel like you accomplished that thing unless you sit back and reflect on that and let it go and move on to the next thing. This is what works for me. This is usually what makes me the happiest, makes me continue to progress and, you know, improve my craft. If it doesn't work for you, I'm sorry about that, but I hope that it will work for some of you and will be useful to you. Thanks for watching and I hope to see you in the next one.", "name": "code-like-a-necromancer.txt", "vector": [0.007089703809469938, -0.017203059047460556, 0.013875662349164486, -0.01996438577771187,

Now before I get into a brief description of what Parcel is and what it can do for you, I want to acknowledge that this is a pretty lengthy video, as you've probably seen, and that might be daunting to some people, or you may just be wondering, you know, why should you spend your time on it. So I do want to start out by pointing out that I do have timestamps for this video, and they're going to be covering each of the steps of the build that I'm putting together. And the nature of the video is that I'm going to start from kind of a bare-bones approach, I'm going to put each piece of Parcel together with some really common setups, which I'll cover in just a moment of all the different things that we're going to go over. But at each of those phases, I'm going to show kind of what Parcel's doing for you, what magic it's doing under the hood, kind of comparing and contrasting that to other bundlers such as Webpack, which I've covered previously in a few videos. I also make commits throughout the video, and the final repository will be uploaded, and it'll be in the description, in case, you know, you are jumping around to any different timestamps, kind of choosing your own adventure, and you want to reference the code at that point. The end state of the repo will be at the very end of the video. So you might have heard of Parcel, and you might be wondering what it is. So I'll give a brief description here. It's a JavaScript bundling tool, which is very similar to something like Rollup or Webpack, you might consider it a competitor to those. And the thing that it does that stands out is its innovations in sort of magically doing things for you. They commonly call it a zero configuration bundler, which has some debate on whether it's actually a zero config or not. But for most people's setups, the Parcel team claims that there's no configuration required, which is pretty appealing when you're contrasting that to something like Webpack, which obviously requires a kind of legendary amount of configuration that's very daunting for people. Now, if you're not really familiar with any of those, I'll just say that it's a way to use sort of modern JavaScript and have transpiling benefits so that you can get kind of cross browser support. It's a way to do work with frameworks like Viewer, React, or Svelte, or any of those, as well as even supporting TypeScript. I think Parcel is a great fit for newer JavaScript developers in particular, new developers in general, because contrasting that to Webpack, I don't think they should spend a lot of time learning how to configure everything and get wild with all this configuration before they just focus on making things and getting things done and learning how to actually build things. Webpack to me is something that you kind of graduate to when you need more customization and more fine-grained control. That's just personally my experience with it. Parcel is also great for experienced developers. I like it a lot as a sort of prototyping tool. When an idea hasn't really proven itself to be worthy of working on for a long time, it's just so fast to set up and have a lot of conveniences and you can kind of just get going and start working, getting things done. But there are also teams that use it for enterprise-level apps, so I just want to throw that out there as well. So let me briefly just kind of go over the list of what we're going to cover in this. A lot of those will be broken up into the timestamps that I mentioned previously, and then we'll jump into the video. So as I said before, we're going to be setting up a minimal project from scratch with Parcel, so that's where we'll start, kind of what entry points you need, what are the minimum files you need to just kind of get going, and what that output looks like right away. Along the way, I'm going to be showing when Parcel can sort of magically find dependencies for us and add them to our Node modules and to our package JSON without any configuration or manual package installs, which is really awesome. And we'll be covering Vue, React, Svelte, TypeScript, modern JS features like conditional chaining and fallbacks for those, also using a browsers list to customize those fallbacks for cross-browser support, importing images in JavaScript, which is a lot of times something you have to set up, SAS, stylus, styled components, pug, and multiple entry points as well. And a final note is that this entire project is showing many different ways that you can set up Parcel. It's not necessarily meant to be a realistic app, but it is demoing it from the perspective of creating a web app, like a single page app or a multiple entry point app. So now that you're equipped with an overview of what the entire video is going to be covering, let's start coding. All right, let's kick this off by creating our directory for this new project. I'm just going to call it Parcel. We're going to cd into that directory and then I'm just going to open it in code, my editor of choice. Let me bring that down here. Okay, close that. And we have this empty project. So what I'm going to do first is I'm going to create a source directory and I'm going to create an index.html in there. And then while I'm at it, I'm also going to create an index.js file. Okay, you don't have to put this in source, it's just what I'm going to do to save myself some time down the road. In our JS file, we're going to do something really simple. We're just going to console.log and I'll just say is work and I'll save that. And then I'm going to go over here to HTML and I'll just use the bang.mp shortcut and come down here and we'll say parcel example is the title. And then in this content I'll just put h1 parcel example just so we can see that. And then I'm also going to point to that script. So this is the minimum necessary for parcel to run. You need an entry point, which is an HTML entry point that you're going to point it at, and then it also needs to, you know, load in a script of course. So from there we'll just say dot slash index.js since it's in the same directory there. And that'll be it. So the next thing I'm going to do is I'm going to jump back over to the terminal. And rather than installing this locally, what I'm going to do is I'm going to say npx and we can just do parcel bundler and then we'll point it at our index.html. So if you're not familiar, npx is a way to kind of download a single time this npm package and run it. So at this point it says, oh you know what that needs to be source index.html you silly goose. So that's good to know that that tells you that no entries were found. We'll run that and you can see that it has built and is already serving us this server, which is really nice. So I'll click that and go to it and there we go. I'm going to inspect this and you can see my console log is working. So pretty simple, but just to show that's how easy it is to set up, you know, very very minimal config. Now this is a server with hmr which is hot module replacement, but we do have to enable that, which we'll do in just a moment. For now I want to show you, if we come over here into our directory, you'll see that we have this dist folder and this cache folder now. Interesting, huh? So the dist is just the output as you would imagine, but one thing that you want to pay attention to, while this is the same index.html file for the most part, you can see that this script has automatically pointed it to the built version of our javascript, which is going to be right here. And this javascript file, this is our bundle, is actually has a ton of stuff in it now. If we were to search really quickly for console.log is work, you can see that's there, that's the only code that we have. And obviously this is a bit of scaffolding for, you know, the future and all the other things that it's going to do, so it's a lot bigger than just our minimal one. But that's the gist of it. So that's really cool that, you know, right off the bat this index.html thing just takes care of that for us. We don't need any sort of plugins or anything like that. It'll just output it and point it to all the right files that it has for its entry point. Oh, I also should point out that you get source maps right out of the bat, which we'll see like a little more featureful in a moment, but just check this out when you look at this console.log in our browser. We'll bump that up a tiny bit more, I'm sure that's fine for now, but we'll probably want that in the future. This has this, where is it telling us? Oh, well, it's source index.js. Even though that's not the script that our server's, you know, loading, it's the source map telling us that. This is the actual full one. So that's pretty cool. So next we're going to enable HMR just to show that real quick. And I'll briefly talk about that. So this is our actual original index file, and just minus that for a moment. So here, in order to showcase that, what I'm going to do is I'm going to just add a simple little input field here, you know, type equals text or whatever doesn't matter, and just to kind of showcase the difference between hot module replacement and not. So HMR is sort of like live reloading, if you're familiar with that, where every time you save your document, you're going to, so it's commonly called hot reloading as well, by the way, HMR, but you know, with live reloading, every time you save the document is refreshed. And so the, that's great, but the problem with that compared to hot reloading is that you lose all of your kind of local app state or your app state in general. So where that's really useful is like, let's say you're kind of designing this component, and you're fiddling around with like some state that it takes a user a few clicks, or you're filling out a form or something like that. Every time you save, it's going to refresh that state. So I'm going to show that real quick. So we can show the comparison here. So right now, if I were to type, you know, whatever here in this silly, small little input, it's kind of small for you, but bear with me for a second, it's going to go away. What if I were to go and change my JavaScript in any way? So let's go, it's going to be hard to alt tab here, but let's go back to this index.js here. And then we'll just say, we'll change this to, it does indeed work. Now what's going to happen when I save this is that page is going to be reloaded really fast. Unfortunately, I can't tab to it fast enough to show you, I guess I could split it, but this, this little spinner will turn to an X just really briefly, but notice that our text is gone here. So just taking that away. So let's kind of show a contrast to that real quick. You know, it's probably worth showing, honestly. This should be good enough, even though it'll be hard to read here. So if I do this, and then I'm going to change this to whatever as well, as soon as I save that, see that blinks and then it goes away. So what we can do now, we're losing real estate here, is we can simply just in this script, in this entry point, we can say if module.hot, so it'll check for that, and then it'll say module.hot.except, there you go. And then when we save that, that's going to give us hot reloading. And so now, I don't believe we have to restart the server, but change things. We save, you'll see that this console was cleared. That's an HMR runtime, so that's a good indicator that it's working correctly. So now, if I type whatever in here, and then I also, you know, do some nonsense here, and I save, you'll see that my new log is there, but I didn't lose this state. And that's going to be true for like everything. What's really cool is like CSS will kind of be able to be injected. It uses like web sockets under the hood, but I'm not very knowledgeable about that, so I don't really want to speak to that. But yeah, you can think of it that way, that that's kind of like when you change your CSS and your dev tools, how the browser doesn't need to reload. Well, it's the same thing going to be with JavaScript and CSS now. The browser doesn't need to reload every time you're changing that, which is really neat. Now, let's actually install Parcel and run our scripts locally from some package.json stuff. So we're going to do, I guess we'll probably need an init, won't we? Did we already make a package? Nope, we didn't. So we'll do npm init dash y, just to skip all the questions, that's dash yes. And now I'm going to do npm i dash d, and we'll do the same thing, parcel bundler. So now we're just installing it locally, which is kind of the recommended way, you know, rather than relying on a global one. If you want to use the global one, that's fine, but typically you install it locally in your project so you can run all the commands. So now we'll pop back over to here, and we'll open our package.json right here. And in our package.json, we're not going to be doing any testing here, so I'm just going to make a script, and I'll make a dev script because that's what they do in the docs. Actually, you know what, that's going to bug me, so I'm going to make it start because it's just easier to type. Maybe I'll make both. And this one, all I have to do is run that same command that I ran at the beginning, just parcel and then point it at your entry point. Really simple and straightforward. Now we're going to run a build script as well at some point, and this parcel build index.html, that's all you do. So you're just going to tack on build onto the command, and that's going to build you a production version of your site, which is really sweet. And a quick note, you know, keep an eye on this parcel version that I'm using, because, you know, if you're watching this video in the future and it bumps and you have any sort of issues, typically that's the first place you want to look is make sure the versions are all the same. And I'll have a repo with this code up in the description of this video for those that, you know, want to reference it while following along, or it'll be the end state of the video basically. So if you just want to look at any of the code and see if you missed up any syntax or just want to reference it, it'll be there. Okay, so let's make sure our scripts run, right? Come back over to here, and the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to do npm run build, and we can see we had no, you know, I did the same thing again. I don't know why I did that. Source. Source. The original docs have it in the root, and that was what was in my brain. Sorry. So npm run build, and voila! And it's pretty cool.

You'll notice that our bundle size is already 1.17 kb, which is actually probably a little bit bigger than webpack would be at this size, but I don't really think that has, you know, scalability problems to any extent. You know, I would keep an eye on that, but it's going to be, you know, as the app grows, it's going to need a lot of that code anyways. And then I'll do npm start. Start my server up, and there you go. We're back and running again. We can reload, and we can see everything is nice. Now something I want to show from that real briefly is if you go to our dist folder now, make this a little bit bigger, you'll see that here we have multiple files here. The same thing. If we go to index.html, it's only importing this one, but you'll see that there's this file, which looks a little bit different than before, right? And then there's this file, and each of them have their own map, and this is the one that we saw before. Well, that's because Parcel does not clean right out of the bat. It doesn't delete the dist folder every time you run, and it doesn't seem to have a command to do that from what I've seen. So, you know, you might want to add to your package.json, you know, whatever your operating system command for, like, let's say building or something you could do. You could do it on both, you know, rmrf dist or something like that. But the thing about that is, typically, it's not really that much of a problem because the server is only going to be running at one time. It's going to be running this one command, so there's not going to be that issue when you're actually deploying it. And if you're running it locally, you know, you can either delete it manually or you can put your own command for that. So I'm not going to do that. I just wanted to let you know about that. So for now, I'm just going to, you know, get rid of that. And I'm actually curious. I have the server running, so I wonder if I, like, save or something that's going to rebuild. It doesn't seem like it. I go to the index.html, save. Ah. Worth a try, worth a try, right? So let's restart that again. Built the bundle, reload the page, everything's working, and our dist is back to just having that single file, that single JavaScript file. So I think this is a pretty good time to set up a git repo and commit our changes real quick before we start doing some bundle stuff. And that'll actually help us track what parcel is changing in the package.json for us because it does that, and it's actually pretty neat, but, you know, a little magical. So we're going to do a.git ignore really simply, and we'll say node modules, of course, and we're actually going to ignore dist as well as.cache. Now, this.cache directory, I don't really know a ton about that other than it's what Parcel uses to keep the builds quick. So, you know, standard caching type stuff. I'm sure it's not standard. I'm sure it's very fancy, but you get the point. So then we'll go back over to the terminal here and git init, git add dash a, and git commit dash m, and we'll just make this, you know, initial, partial, parcel setup. I want to say parcel there so bad. So, you know, if you're using the the repo from the description, then you can go to look at any of the commits if you want to see that timestamp, but there's the name. So now that we have, you know, our git setup, so we have a fallback, a commit to fallback to, what I'm going to do is I'm actually going to do npm run build one more time just so that you have the data right in front of you. And just remember that this is this size. We'll come right back and look at it. 1.17 kb for our bundle. And let's compare this to webpack just to see. So we can actually just really quickly do webpack cli, and then we just say, okay, well, the mode is equal to production just to get that, you know, bundling normally. It does that by default, but it yells at you. So I'm going to add the flag. And here you can see this main.js is the bundle, and it says it's only 36 bytes. And let's actually look at the code just to see, you know, what it output here. Go to main.js. This is from webpack. Look how lean that is. It really just found, you know, that that was just a console log and nothing extra. So, you know, this isn't to hate on parcel or anything like that. Like, you know, you know, parcel 2 is coming out and has a bunch of advancements. This is webpack 5, so it's kind of the latest and greatest here. But as of right now, webpack is actually building a much leaner bundle just from this minimal example, which is interesting because a lot of people that do bundle comparisons, typically they're doing webpack 4 and parcel, but they show that parcels bundles are actually smaller and faster. So who knows? Everything changes at scale. I'm not trying to start a war between them or anything like that. I'm really just trying to, you know, give you the tools to show, okay, like, this is kind of how we can, you know, make sure to keep an eye on these things as we're progressing forward in the project and keep an eye on our bundle size. Okay, so I am going to wipe out that disk one more time because I don't care about any of that stuff right now. So some common confusion that comes up is that with, we are obviously building an app, you know, we're not building libraries right now, and a really common pattern for webpack and parcel is to build a single page app where you have the single entry point and then all of your routing is going to be done through JavaScript, whether that's React Router if you're using Router or any of the other frameworks ways of routing. A question that comes up a lot when I was doing webpack videos is, you know, how do you do multiple pages? Well, typically in a single page app that's going to be handled all through, you know, your JavaScript, but if you do want to do multiple entry points, you totally can. So I want to show that right off the bat. So in source, I'm going to make this folder now, a new folder here, and I'm going to name it just pages, and I'm going to move this index.html into that folder there, and I'm going to copy it. I think that'll maybe be slightly faster, and I'm going to rename this to about.html. And so in this about.html, well actually let's make a link to that just so we can go there really easily. So we'll do an a tag and then we'll just say slash about.html. Now this is an important thing. About us, or you know, whatever. I don't know why I picked that name. This is a very important thing. The dot html is required here. You're not going to get the pretty URLs from this, and I actually haven't figured out an easy way to do that with Parcel. There is a plugin that someone's made, but it didn't really have that many downloads, so I decided not to include it in the video. So if anyone knows how to handle this, I'm not really sure outside of, you know, on your server kind of hard setting that, but you know, obviously when you're running your dev server, you still have to have this. So it's kind of weird. If you don't know what I mean, I just mean that you can't type like this, which is commonly called a pretty URL. So we have to include the dot html. That's the point. And if we go over to our about html, let's just change this to the h1 to be, you know, about us, and you know, it'll have an a tag that goes back to slash index dot html, and then that will just say home. They're both going to import the same script for right now, just to get it running. And I'll get rid of that input, because we don't really need that input anymore, do we? Oh, and I almost forgot, we will need to actually move the directory up one, because our index.js, we put this in the pages folder, and we need to go up one. Very easy to forget that. I think that should be good. So let's npm start, start the server up. Let's see. Oh, you know what, we need to change our script. Haha, it's not good. So when we come into package.json, you know, we told it it's in source index html as the entry point. We want multiple entry points now, right? So we need to say source pages slash star. So we can use this pattern to say anything, start on html. We can say anything here that says source pages start on html, any of the html files and pages. Pages do the same thing, star dot html. Let's try that again. And that's how I built. So we'll come over here, we'll reload the page. You can see our console log still reporting. And now we have this about us page, which is kind of weird, because we went to the root. I've had this a couple of times, and it's pretty strange. Now we're at index html, it's like if you go to the root, it just like finds the first page in there, I guess. But now we're going between index html and about us. Let me see if we go to the root again, what it does. Yeah, I guess it just finds the first page. That's interesting. So I'm not going to get into fixing that on the server. I just want to show, you know, multiple entry points pretty easily. And the thing that you'll want to see right here is when we go to the about us page, it has the exact same JavaScript, right? And most of the time when you're doing multiple entry points, that's not what you want. So we'll just really briefly, you know, make another file here and source new file and do about.js console.log. The about page. Okay, go back over here. And that should have already reloaded for us. Oh, it didn't. Oh, we need to change our entry. I'm making all sorts of mistakes today. Go to about html. And then here we want to change our index to be about.js. Come back over here and it is already live reloaded for us. In this case, it's not hot reloading because I didn't put that hot tag. Keep that in mind. So that's really easy, right? Multiple entry points that are using their own JavaScript files. You'll see some crazy stuff that we can do with that in just a bit. Let's make another commit super fast. I'm just going to add all this stuff and then we'll say add multiple entry points. That's where we're at. The next thing I want to show is really cool. It is that you can have modern JavaScript features without any configuration as well. So let's do this. We're going to make an object here. Then in that object, I'm just going to make up some properties. I'll say A is for Apple Crisp, the light, and then B is going to be butter cream, and C is actually going to be a nested object for my purposes. So then we'll just chain it on. Cheese Danish. Beautiful. Then we're going to console log that. So first, we'll just log the normal, .c,.cd. So we're doing a regular chain. These are properties that all exist. I'm not to the super features yet. If we go back to home, you'll see, I'm just going to get rid of this log because it's silly, but you can see we're logging out. Cheese Danish. Not surprising. But if you go into dist and we're going to look at the source file here, and let's take a look at our console.logs. Can't type. You'll see that the code is very normal. Keep an eye on this. This console log right here, object C.cd, nothing fancy, no fancy transpiling or anything. Now, if we go back to, and I'm going to get rid of this one just to keep it clear. If we go back here and let's say we want to log that out, but we also wanted to log out something that did not exist. Let's say object.f.fa or something. I don't know why the letters I chose are what they are, but they are what they are. Now, I'm going to do this cool thing called conditional chaining of this question mark. I'll explain this in just a moment if you haven't seen this before. So what this is going to do is normally when we, I guess I should have showed that first. Normally, when we try to access this, we're going to get an error. I will show it first, why not? Because this property doesn't exist and we're trying to access something on undefined, which is obviously a big JavaScript no-no. But what this conditional operator here does is it falls back safely, and it says, does this exist? Okay, then does this exist? If anything in that chain doesn't, then it will just come back as undefined. So first, let's show the error. Uncaught type error cannot read property fa of undefined. Then I'm going to go back to having conditional there, and look at that. We got a safe fallback, undefined. Now, let me show you why I was having you glimpse that before in here. Notice that now, we're in our bundle, and this console log is pretty crazy. So this is transpiling an action. It's taking modern JavaScript features and using Babel, and making some cross-browser safe, browsers that don't have this feature yet, just without any configuration at all. That's really nice. I got to hand it to them for that one. That's really cool. Just because I am a sucker for being thorough, what I'm going to do is I'm going to copy-paste this, because you might not know that this works just fine in Chrome. Just paste that in and run the code. It works fine, right? What it's doing this for is something like IE, which dreadfully open. Gosh, every single time. Go away, so bad. I'm going to go to about blank, so I don't have to look at that. Okay, then how do I do this again? It's been so long. F12, developer tools. If you have to deal with this every day, I'm very sorry. I can paste this code in here, run it, and you can see that we get this syntax error when we try to paste that code, right? Now, if we go back to... I know I say it right, like you can answer me. We go back to this, and we... Oh, no. There we go again. So much pain. Okay, there we go. So we're running our server, which is running our transpiled code, and that was the point I was trying to show, is that this code runs correctly in IE11. So like I said, no configuration, and you've got some awesome cross-browser support. Now I'll purge that from my memory. So because I'm going to make some changes right here, I'm going to do one more commit, because I want you to see the diff here. So I'm just going to say show modern JS transpiling for that checkpoint. Okay, so for a quick reference, our package JSON here just has this one dev dependency that we've manually installed, the parcel bundler, okay? Now what we're going to do is we're going to add some SAS just to get straight to it. So in my source, I'm going to add a new folder. I'm going to say that this is a styles folder, why not? And I'm going to add a new file, and then I'm going to call this index.scss. And to save you some time, I will paste this in. So what we have in here is we're just using this main BG here with bisque is the color, lovely color, and then we're going to combine that with chocolate for a delicacy to remember. Now this chocolate is using a SAS variable just to show that we can. I just want to point out that you probably wouldn't have a lot of value from SAS variables when you have CSS", "name": "parcel.txt", "vector": [0.012876310385763645, 0.022710230201482773,

"variables, but you might still like them. So, you know, you do you. And then we also have some nesting here that's going on. Just, you know, the usual SAS stuff that you'd like. Now what I want to show with this is that I'm going to save this file, but it hasn't been imported yet at all, okay? So the only file change we have is this. But what I will do is I will go into, go away, I'll go into my index.js file, and we're going to import that in JavaScript. So we're just going to import, and then this is typically how you do it. You're going to go to styles and then index, oops, index.scss. I don't know why VS Code could never autocomplete CSS for me. I'm going to save that. And you saw on the left here, maybe, that something changed, right? And if we go over to this, a few things have actually changed. And I wish I could have Alt-Tabbed to show you fast enough, but behind the scenes, the server here, went and ran some stuff real quick, and actually went and downloaded SAS for us, added it to our package.json. Isn't that wild? So let's see if that did anything. Whoa, right? Pretty cool. So this is our page as before, and it's got all these styles already there. If we inspect this, we can see, this might be a little big for me, but for your sake, I'll bear with it. But the body, and this Chrome does this cool thing now where it like shows us flex box. It's kind of hard to see that you're hovering over it. So I've added flex for demonstration purposes to this. And you can see here that the background has been set there, and it's already like, you know, turned that SCSS into CSS. And that's why we just have this color chocolate here. We're using a CSS variable, but this was a SAS variable and it's been converted. Even though we're looking at the CSS, notice that it says index SCSS. And that's what I was pointing out before is, it has source maps built in without any special config property, which isn't that hard to set up in Webpack or anything like that, but it's kind of cool that it just comes right out the bat, right out the box. I mean, so here we can see the original color was set to this text color and all that good stuff. Not gonna go over source maps too much here. You know, it's just a way to see the original code if you aren't familiar with that so that we can troubleshoot easily in our own code. So it was that easy. We didn't even have to install SAS. I just made a SAS file and imported it and it worked. I'll also show you really briefly that say, you didn't want to install it or import it in your JavaScript. You can actually do the same thing in your index HTML with a link tag here. So if we did, you know, link CSS, we could then point to a.slash, where are we at? ..slash styles and then index.css. And actually let me comment that out just so you can see there's no styles. Come back here, come back in, and you've got styles again. Pretty cool, right? And I guess I could have just showed you that the link is here, but check this out. See how that name is different? It's doing all of the stuff behind the scenes for us. It's automatically building all those links for us and saying, okay, yeah, you imported this in the HTML file. And I know that when I get output that HTML file, I need to reconnect that up to the bundled version, which is gonna be minified in a production environment. So there's a lot of awesome magic behind the scenes going on that I wanted to point out. So I'm gonna put that back where it was. So I would prefer to do it here, but just know you can do that. Now, while all of those magical things do come with it that we've shown, one thing that it does not start with is browser prefixes. So if you go over to this, I was gonna show Flexbox to show that, but actually now that I think about it, I think that Flexbox might be supported in a wide enough browsers that the default, can I use browser list is going to be a little bit more is going to not auto prefix it. So to make sure, let's use a super modern feature here. So I'm gonna go into my index SAS file and for the H1, I'll add this line, these three lines, I should say, I'll put a break here. So we're gonna do a fun effect here and we're using this background clip, which is very modern. And to show you that actually, we can go to can I use here and there's this background clip text just to show that. And then when you hover over Chrome, you can see, whoops, right here. You can see it is supported, but it's kind of tiny for you, only with the dash webkit prefix. That's perfect, we need a vendor prefix to test that. And you'll see when we come over to our styles here that this doesn't really quite look right, or maybe you like that, but it's not what I'm intending. So let's set up some PostCSS to get that working. So I'll start by creating a new file and say postcss.config.js. This is where you normally dump all of your PostCSS config stuff, of course. And I'm gonna do module.exports equals object and we're gonna put a plugins key here. And this is just a pretty normal thing if you set up PostCSS is one of the main ones that you usually do. And I like to do PostCSS preset-env, which if you're familiar with auto-prefixer, this actually comes with it. It's a bunch of presets that they recommend. Now, when I save that, this is one of those times where nothing magical has really happened here. We still just have parcel, bundler and sass as our changes and nothing new besides that. I guess something that I kind of don't like here is while all this stuff is really magical and cool that it's auto doing all this stuff for us, right now we're trying to require something that the PostCSS preset-env and because we're so used to everything kind of handling it for us, it's kind of weird when we don't really get any sort of feedback here that that thing doesn't exist. It might be a lot to ask for though. So, whatever, you figure it out. So I'm gonna add that real quick. I'll do PostCSS preset-env. Now I'm not gonna actually add PostCSS, which would normally have to combine with it. And before I install that, I'm gonna show you that's because if you go to our node modules here, and I'll actually just do slash PostCSS, you'll see that we actually already have PostCSS. That just comes installed with parcel. And I've tested that out. It comes like with just plain old parcel, not any other additions to it. So they already have a bunch of stuff that they're including to kind of cover this, but they don't happen to have this preset. And I'm assuming that this is because, you know, bundle size, browser prefixes can add the bundle size. So maybe they opted to say that you should have to opt into that. So this is kind of the first sort of config that we're really having to do. And it's worth pointing out because there's a, it's a really hot topic. What is zero configuration in this world? You know, the parcel team has stated that, you know, they see it as, you know, the majority of use cases, not needing any configuration files consists of or accounts for zero config. And some people are absolute in that. And they're saying, no, if you have to do any config, it's not zero config. I don't really think it's that cut and dry. To me, you're setting up, you know, config for your own stuff. You're not having to configure, you know, right now, any of the Babel stuff or any of that stuff in this. I want to opt into kind of customizing that my own way. And I know parcel two is actually setting it up to where they're going to have a config file. So keep an eye out for that. So let's see, now that I've installed post-CSS preset ENV, if I just, oops, I just run start, we'll see if it does anything. Look at that, it just worked. Isn't that beautiful? So now we have this nice gradient behind our text. And if we scroll down here, we will see, oops, I'll be on the H1. You'll see that this linear gradient here, not the linear gradient, what am I thinking? The background clip, background clip added this vendor prefix for us, WebKit background clip. So that wasn't too hard, but let's take it one step further with the fact that on our body, we had this flex right here and it doesn't have a fallback for that. And maybe I want support for that. So what I'm going to do is also add a, let's go down to here. In the root, I'm going to add a.browserslistrc, okay? A dot is important, or you can do config file with JS. And I'm going to do last two versions, pretty standard here. I could do one or whatever, greater than 0.5%. I'm just kind of pulling these common numbers out of my head. And then IE11, that's the important part. So I'm going to save that. And then I'll come back over to here and we'll see if it worked. And you'll notice that that didn't do anything, okay? And so what you could do is you, or you might think is you could just like rerun the server. This is a common thing to see if it added that. And notice that, I just noticed my head might be in the way sometimes. Whoops, sorry. It looks like it's okay. Well, it wasn't in the way of that link, but move this over a bit. So this display flex still doesn't have any new WebKit properties. And I know that it should when it's trying to support IE11. So this brings me to something that's kind of a weird little quirk that I've found. It seems like saving this or saving any of like the entry points doesn't really get it to rebuild, but saving this post CSS config actually got it to rebuild for me. And check that out. I just saved that. I know you couldn't really see it, but I pressed Control S. And now I have all of these vendor prefixes and that'll just be that way from now on. It's like the caching is, might be a little too aggressive. It doesn't really know to check that unless you save post CSS config. So there's a little gotcha for you and a solution for it. So restarting the server isn't enough. You have to actually go and save the post CSS config file, which is weird because I added a browser's list file, you know, whatever. So let's top this section off by adding CSS modules because I had a little bit of a gotcha there too. And, you know, that's a common paradigm that people like to use. So let's show how to do it. Now with post CSS modules, what we're gonna do is I will add an additional H2 here just to get targeted. And then I'll say CSS module example. And then in my index.js, I'm just gonna be really silly and say, let's store the H2 as document.querySelector. We're just gonna grab an H2. And then we will say H2.classList.add. And, you know, normally I could add whatever I want here and show that that class was added just to make sure that, you know, we know it's working. And then what I'll do is I'll make a file that is called CSS modules.js or CSS. Let's call it modules.styles. And I'm just gonna make an H2, actually I'll make a class, I'll make a heading. And then I'll say Z32 and color is rosy brown. That's all I need. And then I will import that, but, you know, we import that as like styles or something that we wanna name it. And we'll go up, it's in this directory, isn't it? Styles slash module styles.css. And then I can just pass that class in here, styles.heading. Okay, now I'll just really briefly go over this if you're not familiar with it, you know, not the purpose of the video to explain every single thing in there, but really briefly, I can spend a moment. It's what you're doing here is you are making a regular CSS file, but with CSS modules, what happens is when you import it, you can actually access all of these different like properties on it. And you normally, you wouldn't do it in this way. This is a very silly way. It's just a quick way to demo it, but you would do it in like, let's say React, you know, you could import it and put it on your JSX, for example. And that will automatically hash the class name. So you don't have any scope conflicts and you can reuse the same class names over and over at like a component level scope. That's as much as I'm gonna go into it. But what I want to show here is that, you know, when I reload this, I just get undefined. It's a class name. So, you know, that's not that surprising. Can't automatically figure out every single thing we want to do. So I will npm i dash d post CSS modules. That's the plugin that you usually have to use for post CSS to use modules. That's a common way to do CSS modules. npm start, server backup. Saw it doing some module style stuff. Let's reload. And notice it didn't do anything. This is where the gotcha is gonna kick in. So the docs tell you that you need to go into post CSS config, and I'll actually show you this in the docs in just a moment, and say modules true. And that's all you need, right? Then when I reload here, it doesn't seem to have done anything. It doesn't update that. And if I restart the server, reload, still not doing anything. Sometimes you have to, like I said, you have to save this post CSS, which should have done it. There you go. One of the saves will trigger it. It's a lot easier to see when you have it in two separate windows, I'm sorry. And you'll see that you get this crazy error, post CSS eight for end users. And post CSS plugin, post CSS modules requires post CSS eight. It's a lot of saying post CSS. And I'll just show that in the docs so you know that I'm not crazy. If we go to CSS, what is it? Modules true. Oh, here it is. I don't know why I didn't find that when I searched it. Oh, because I had quotes around it. Duh. This is JSON. So yeah, modules true right here. Kinda tiny there. That's what they want you to have, but it actually breaks your stuff, unfortunately. And that's because it's not necessarily Parcel's fault here. Go back to that error so you can see while I'm talking about it. So the issue here, I've actually seen this on view forms for view three as well. Post CSS moved to post CSS eight, which was obviously a breaking change to move from seven. And a lot of the plugins that you install, like CSS modules by default are now paired with eight, but Parcel automatically installing post CSS for us installs seven. So I tried to manually install eight, but then it causes more problems with some of its backwards compatibility. It's a real nightmare. So the easiest way to get around this right now for me is to say npm i dash d and post CSS modules. What we got, really quickly, what we got when we installed modules was four. And we want version, you know, any three. So I'll do caret three at caret three. Okay. Now I'll do npm start again, and I've installed that. Let's see if it just works. I might have to save it again. And there you go. Look, I've got my color, my rosy brown. And then here's what you really wanna look at is this hashed class name. So once you know it, it's a really easy fix, but it was very annoying to figure out. Blah. So we've run into one of our first hiccups, obviously with", "name": "parcel.txt", "vector": [0.021770812571048737, 0.009348884224891663, -0.001975284656509757, 0.003844719845801592,

thing, but I don't really wanna hold that against you for that one, because like I said, Vue 3 has problems with it as well, though they do a bunch of auto-magical config stuff as well. It just seems to kind of be an ecosystem type thing where certain things are moving forward. And it would have been a lot easier, I think if I was, you know, in something where I'm installing every single thing, like I was in a web pack project, because I would actually be choosing to install post CSS and all my other stuff wouldn't rely on that different version, but not that big a deal in the end. So let's commit and move on from this one. We did a bunch of stuff here. We added a browser's list, and then we also did post CSS, and we added our Sass. We did all of that. So let's just say add Sass, post CSS, browser's list, CSS modules is too long of a commit name, but it's fine. There you go. So I think next ought to be TypeScript. I just want to show that my server is still indeed running. There you go. And coming on back to our code, what we're gonna do here is I'm going to change the index HTML to point to index.ts now. I'm gonna have to change... oh no, that one has its own, so I'll just change this one. And when I save that, it's going to get unhappy because that doesn't exist. So let me actually... I'll probably get mad either way, so I'll just save it. I'm gonna rename this to a TS file, and when I go into that TS file, you can see this is just VS Code. If you ever name something.ts, it's gonna automatically start giving you TypeScript hinting. But what we want to see is did it build? So we'll need to restart that because we changed some paths that didn't exist. That's fine. And look at that. It says installing TypeScript. Interesting, huh? And if we go to our package.json again, look at that. So it has now added TypeScript automatically for us. So if we go back over to our index.ts file, and I guess I should have showed that, you know, the server is actually running again here. We're still getting our cheese danish lovely console log. But one thing that's really cool is notice this little hint here. So it says property f does not exist. So it, you know, it's automatically detecting that in our object, and we're getting some very nice feedback. Lovely TypeScript. And this one, of course, does. This is, you know, something that you'd commonly deal with, you know, in the ecosystem. And then this error is just that CSS, whenever you import in TypeScript, it gets really mad unless you have type definitions for that. And there's a way to set that up, but I'm not gonna go over that. That's out of the scope of this video. But you'll notice something important here. There are these different errors in TypeScript, and particularly this one, and it's still built just fine. Hmm. Well, that's because parcel under the hood uses Babel to compile TypeScript and not the TypeScript compiler. And because of that, Babel essentially does not do type checking. The phrasing for that people debate. What it essentially means is that it's not gonna fail your build when types fail. It just, it's really just taking TypeScript and transpiling it to JavaScript and not doing any checks on the types at all. So this is hotly debated in the community in general for TypeScript, but particularly in parcel TypeScript. There's a whole bunch of GitHub issues where people are very angry about it, and understandably so. So parcel has kind of made this assumption for you, at least in parcel one, where they're kind of assuming you're treating it, I guess you would kind of say like a linter, where your editor is providing all of the type hints for you, and you, if you want to actually fail a build, you can fail it in your continuous integration, through PRs or something like that, so people can't merge code. I'll just show you a real kind of brief example. So you, because you have TypeScript, you could do something like tsc dash dash no emit and and or whatever, depending on your operating system. You have to do this a little bit differently in Windows. But this would make it to where when we go to build, well let's just show it, you know, why talk about it when I can show it, npm run build. It's gonna give you this type failure right here, and it's just gonna immediately fail. Oh, actually, tsconfig. Good thing I did that. So in order to run that command, you will need to at least have a tsconfig.json or whatever you want. You don't actually have to have anything in that, which is kind of funny. I'll just run a build, and now you can see it failing on this module.hot, except here. And it also failed, it should have failed on the other ones. Oh, there they are. Yeah. So your stuff won't build, and so you could do that. But really, that's not great when you're, you know, running a server and automatically changing every save and all that good stuff. It's only gonna run right at the beginning of that. So a lot of people are pretty upset about this, understandably, because, you know, the community of TypeScript, you know, wants that reliability for TypeScript to fail. It needs to be an absolute source of truth that's like, hey, if I clone this down and I run it and it builds, then I know it's good, because TypeScript. So I have not used TypeScript very much with Parcel for these reasons. When I went to set it up, I found all these things, and it was kind of turned me away from it. So maybe some people have found some workarounds that I don't know about. You shouldn't take, you know, my word is law here. This is just my experience for it. And it's kind of the downside is that, you know, the way that a lot of these frameworks add TypeScript support is just through the Babel or Babel, however you want to pronounce it, transpiling, which is cool because it's fast, but it kind of sucks because it doesn't actually do proper type checking. So this might be a deal breaker for you. For me it is. If I'm gonna do a TypeScript project, I'm probably gonna do Webpack still. Maybe it's not a deal breaker for you, and maybe you're fine with just VS Code, giving you the hints. The problem with VS Code, of course, or any editor, is that it's only going to show you the files that you see. It's not going to show you all the files in the entire project unless you had them all open. I think you've had enough of that rant. I just wanted to give you some context around kind of, you know, what's going on with that because it is one of the first kind of limitations that I've hit with Parcel. It doesn't mean that I wouldn't use it for other things, it's just currently I wouldn't use it for Webpack. And I also want to put it out there that the Parcel team knows about this and is said that they are working on changing the way that they're doing it based on community feedback and stuff. So, you know, keep an eye out for some changes there. Maybe it'll be Parcel too. You know, with all that kind of, I guess, that sort of negativity aside, we did get TypeScript up and running and compiling at least pretty quickly. So that's pretty nice if you're just wanting to dabble in it and, like I said, if you're satisfied with the way it is, then that's pretty cool. So we'll just we'll check this off as add TypeScript. And wasn't that neat that we just renamed the file TS and it automatically went and downloaded or installed TypeScript for us? Super crazy. Now here's where the fun begins. So we're gonna add Vue to our app now. And I should put a disclaimer out, this is gonna be Vue 2. It's at the time of the recording. Vue 3 is out, but it's on the next branch and support for it kind of iffy in different areas, especially with the PostCSS bugs that I had before in Parcel. So I'm just gonna do Vue 2 for now. And probably most people would be the most familiar with that as of this point. So what I'm gonna do is I'm going to create a Vue folder separately here. Look at that nice little icon they gave me, that's cute. And then I'm gonna make a index.js file and I will also, I'll just go ahead and make the app.vue file. We're just gonna make it a real simple, sort of like a Vue starter here. So this part I'll just do, you know, we're gonna import Vue from Vue. And I haven't installed it yet, keep in mind. And I'm gonna import app from the app.vue is what we named it. And then we'll just do, you know, the normal Vue. We're gonna render. I actually don't know what H stands for in this context. I've seen it put as like create element. I'm not really sure what that is, but whatever. This is the way that the build tool does it. Then we're gonna target root, right? Yeah, let's do root. So we're gonna mount it to root. I'll save that. And then for the app.vue I'm just gonna paste in some code to save you some time. I should have done that for the other one, but. Okay. Alright, so we've got a few things going on. I'm just gonna really quickly go through this. If you're not familiar with Vue, that's perfectly fine. I'm not gonna go into every little detail. It's gonna be a quick overview. Mm-hmm. And with, if you are familiar with Vue, then you should be able to decently follow along. But I do want to go through it to show you all the crazy stuff that's kind of going on here. So to start, we obviously, we're making our Vue app, and then we're going to render the app there. Doesn't have to be uppercase. I almost messed up. Someone else probably saw that. There you go. It was like so obvious. We're gonna render this app. This is just a normal format for it. And then we have this template. And you'll notice that we're using language pug for it. So this is pug syntax. And I actually like pug a lot. I used to use it a bunch, but whenever I'm doing Vue, I kind of like it. And we're gonna have this counter variable that you can see. And then we're just making a quick list. And actually, I am not going to be able to have this just yet, but maybe I should show it. I'll do, I'll delete it for now. Because I will actually mess it up. So we have a template, language pug. Then we move on, and we have a script. And notice we're using TypeScript. And we are, of course, getting the hinting here. I have purposely said this counter. I've set it to be a string, but it's obviously a number. So it's mad. And then here, just really brief, you know, data. We're gonna return counter. That's what we're rendering up here. And then we have a mounted set interval where it's just gonna count. Very simple. And then finally down here, we're using stylus. So I'm kind of just trying to get crazy. And we're using scope styles. And so I'm setting this up to where it's not just view, but it's also got pug, and it's got stylus, and it's got TypeScript, you know, all built into it. And we're just setting up some basic styles. This is stylus, if you've never seen it before. It's similar to Sass. Okay, so now that I've saved that, let's actually take our pages. We're gonna take our about one, and we're gonna commandeer that. We're gonna set that to view, since we're not doing anything nutty there. And I guess I need to update the link to be view. And then here, this is an index HTML, I'm gonna say, go to the view app. Yeah. And in view, we're gonna need an element of root to grab and kind of, you know, inject all of our view app into. We'll have a link to home still. Why not? And then this should say, view app goes here. And then this about JS, we're gonna go into the view folder and do index JS. And let's see if our server held up through all that. Probably not. I wasn't even running. Oh, well. See, it says, it really briefly said installing view. I don't know if you can see that, but I'll show you. Installing pug, installing stylus, hot reloading. Hmm. So let's open our browser and take a gander here. We have this link now, go to view app. Ooh, and it almost works, but the styles aren't working. But the code is. Don't worry, I expected that. I'm gonna show you why. So you can see that it's counting, which is pretty cool, right? Now, you might think that the styles aren't working because stylus or something like that. I mean, my syntax is weird and you wouldn't be crazy for thinking so, but it's not true. This is a really annoying gotcha that I ran into. And you know, I'm in a kind of crazy world of combining a bunch of stuff, but if you go into post CSS config, remember how we add to add modules true for that CSS modules? That actually breaks view and it's a known issue. So I'm gonna get rid of that and that's because they handle, like, they're scoping their own way, I guess. I'm not really sure. But when you just, like I said before, sometimes you save it, it doesn't work. So what I found you have to do to kind of get it to bust the cache is close the server, reopen the server, and then we'll just go into the entry point and we'll save. And I think that typically does it. No? Save post CSS config. There we go. Save that post CSS config, that's the secret. And there our styles are all working. We've got this lovely counter going on and we have a view app. So yeah, that CSS modules can't have that modules true in post CSS config if you're doing view. And you probably wouldn't anyways because you'd be doing it the view way. So I'm not gonna fault them for that one, but that gave me a lot of aches. But pretty cool, right? So we've got our, you know, our variables, bg styles, dark slate gray, text aquamarine, and then we're using them here just to kind of show stylus in action. And just a real quick hit on this again, notice that this is an error in TypeScript, but it's still building just fine. Just to reiterate that in view it's using TypeScript, but it still has the same problem. Still transpiling with Babel. Oh, and how could I forget? Let's go back to the package JSON here. Let's actually do the diff and show that again. Now this one's pretty wild. So you can see that it's, you saw it adding stylus and pug if you glimpse that really quickly. But you'll also notice that it, oh I don't want to open that. Go back here. Dependencies has been added and that's because view should be a dependency. I don't really know that view hot reload API should be a dependency, but they've chosen to put it there. But view typically should. And then this view template compiler and view component compiler, these were all added and put appropriately in dev dependencies along with everything else. I messed that up. Oh really you're gonna edit that for me, huh? So yeah, that's pretty cool. Once again, I'm really blown away by the the magic of Parcel and how, you know, just this one file having these references to these things it was able to pick all that up and just go ahead and install all those dependencies. Just fire away. I'll wrap this one up by showing that our post CSS stuff is", "name": "parcel.txt", "vector": [0.021993618458509445, 0.009962387382984161, 0.007435342762619257, -0.0022371981758624315,

So if we were to inspect this, we should see... let's do the... where's this container right here? Notice that we have these webkit properties here still for Flexbox. So it is showing that post CSS is still working. And even though it's annoying for me, I'm going to show you by fiddling with this again. So I'll go to post CSS config and I'll just make this an empty object, right? And I don't know if I have to restart the server for that. I do. So we'll do the old restart the server, go back into the code, save post CSS config just to make sure, and then reload this. And you'll see that those are all gone now. The webkit prefixes are not there anymore. So just to show that, you know, out-of-the-box view isn't coming with that, we added that with post CSS and the auto-prefixer. So let me throw that back in there real quick. Shut down the server, restart. It'll get real mad when you do that. As you can see, it dumped a bunch of logs out. And make sure that that's working again. I got to go back in here and save after. It's real tricky. You get some finicky behavior, but here you go. Okay, well I think that wraps up a view for us. Let us segue by going back and putting this line in here that I had before. This React app. Now we're gonna drop that in our project. Let's commit this real quick. And actually, ooh, I need that to not be there during this commit because it'll actually break the build. I don't know if you got to see that. Let me show you. See, it actually tries to look up this page's React.html because we had a link to it, which is kind of cool that it's letting us know that. But it will actually break your stuff. So I'll take that out while I commit this. Add view. And I guess I'll put pug stylus because they came along for the ride. Oh, let me undo that commit real quick. Do last commit. Thought I added them all. I guess I just barely changed that, didn't I? Yeah, that looks right. Cool. Okay, now let's put it back in. Boom. React time. So for this we're gonna do much the same. We will copy this view.html file. I'm just gonna paste it in there. I'm gonna rename it to react.html. And then here in the file, please go over to the file, we'll change this text, of course, to say React app goes here. We're gonna have pretty much all the same stuff except we're now going to look in the React folder for the index.js and we're going to make it a JSX file just to show that that works without any configuration because typically in Webpack you have to set up your resolvers for that. So that will have us coming over here and building a new folder and we're gonna make this folder react, of course, and add a file in there index.jsx. And then this is just your standard, I'll write this out real quick, import react from react. You could do it with star as react. That's how I should be doing it but I haven't updated my snippets. And then I, why didn't you do that? I'm going to go react dom and I haven't installed any of it again yet. No React installations yet. We're gonna have an app so we'll import app from dot slash app dot JSX. Well it'll be shorthanded. And then we're gonna render and let's render that app. And we'll do document dot. We'll use get element by ID this time here. And we're gonna get the ID of root. And because we don't have an app yet let's make that and app dot JSX. And I'm just gonna use a snippet real quick to get this done real fast. We're not gonna pass it anything. We'll just have a div and then we'll have an h2 because we already have an h1 on the page. And I will make that is react running. It's not really running, it just isn't rendering. Should be what it is but. Now is our server still running here? It usually won't be able to hold up to me changing file names around. So I'll restart that and you should see it installing React. Doing some extra stuff too. React dom. Hmm. Okay. Let's reload this and we're on the view one and we made this link to React. And React is running! At least it's rendering. Right? Let's make sure by adding some state real quick. It's one thing to transpile JSX but so what I'll do is I'll just I'll do IMRUS. Get that going there. We'll make that here and we just call it use state why not. And I'll start it off as false. And then what I'll do is I'll be really silly and on an h2 I will put an on click. And this on click is just gonna be an anonymous function and we're going to set state and we'll set that to the opposite of what our state is and then we'll change this to say oops. Huh that shortcut doesn't work. That's so sad. We'll change this to say what is state. What is state? And then we'll render the state and but we need to turn it into a string because otherwise it will just you know false out and be nothing. Really simple app here right? Let's go back here and see. We've got reactivity. It's like hard to do that without dragging. Now we come back to our code. You know the package.json you already saw it doing this but isn't that neat in the dependencies it is thrown in here react and react-dom. So it's done that for us as well. I'm kind of beating a dead horse at this point aren't I? But I I really think it's worth mentioning how each of these different frameworks it they've taken the time to handle and install things for you and quite frankly that's amazing. So I think the next thing that I'd want to you know make sure works is images because typically there's some configuration to do that in any sort of bundler right like especially JavaScript or rollup. It's not super hard but you know you're gonna need them. So I'm just gonna copy some images in here and all I've got is just a few different logos all right and what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna straight up import this and say let's call this SWC logo from and we'll do dot dot slash images slash and it never auto completes these for me unfortunately but we'll do this logo dot JPG and then we'll just drop an image tag here and for the source we will make it point why did it not backspace both quotes rude. SWC logo. I'll get rid of that and I don't care about the alt tag right now obviously. Let's see if that loaded. Boom! No config. Just got images working from imports. Okay so that was a JPG. Let's just really quickly change that to a PNG and see how that behaves and oh my goodness that is big. Let's go down here and set the width just to be lazy and set that to like 800 and there you go. So you got a PNG loading right but can I do SVGs? Spoiler again. All right that looks the same right? So let's inspect it and look it's output this little file here dot SVG. So I guess that's a point to leave a quick note here is these are all image sources which is super cool that they work but actually rendering SVG code like the SVG XML code into the DOM so that you can change it with CSS selectors and stuff like that is always problematic for me and in a lot of frameworks especially I've had a lot of problems with it with React. You usually have to have some sort of package that converts it to React component and the syntax isn't quite the same as JSX etc etc. I've also had the same problems with Parcel. I had a hard time finding out how to like directly render it because if I just render you know SWC logo right now it's just gonna be text it's just the path. So if anyone knows like an easy way to do that that would be awesome if you could leave a comment on that because I always struggle to find a good way to render out my SVGs. You get it. You get it. So bam bam boom there you go images. Cool. Let's make a commit. Add React images. React in images. That was it. Now this really surprised me actually. Now this is cool. So that we have all the great flavors of CSS going we've got styles, we've got sass, we've got CSS, we've got CSS modules. We're gonna put style components in here now. And so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to import style components from here and then I'm going to create a style component and I'm gonna call it container. It's just a div, nothing crazy. And I'll put one thing on it for now just so we've got it. I'll do display flex right. I'm gonna save that. Oh I caught it. You can see it redoing some fancy stuff. And before I go over to the page, let's see, look at that. My mind was blown on that one. The React thing, the view thing, those were all really cool. But wow, like just an import of style components and you just detected that and installed it for me? That's cool. So let's change this to a container. If you aren't familiar with style components, I won't spend much time on that, but they're a CSS and JS type of format if you've ever heard that form. It basically takes every sort of set of styles and turns them into a component so that all the styles are scoped to that component. Also a very hotly debated thing, but I like them so go away. So here we'll do, you know, I'm gonna type this out just so you can see. So we can do flex direction column. I thought you could do FTC there. Can you do DF or display flex? Or is that, I'm just curious now, DF. Oh you have to do DFL. Yeah, okay. Anyways, I wanted to show this real quick that you'll notice that I have syntax highlighting in here and also I'm getting like emmet completion. You know, I can go PIC, place, it doesn't have that one. Let me show you another one. Let's do BGC for background color. We're gonna do midnight blue. Then we'll do color is cornflower blue. And then we'll do FFSS. This is really cool one that I like. If you ever just want to do a quick sans serif FFSS. And so what I'm showing here is that this is Emmet, if you're not familiar with it. I have to do control space for that one for some reason. And this works inside style components if you have, I believe you have to have a VS Code plugin. So you can actually do P40 here. And I've made you watch me type this up long enough so I'll really quickly do it. But what I wanted to show was style components. There's this plugin, VS Code style components. And this gives you syntax highlighting and kind of treats it as a language so that you can get the CSS auto completion for IntelliSense and all that stuff. So you're gonna want that if you're ever using style components in VS Code. All right, let's finish this up super fast. Not much left. I will do FC 64 here. And then we just need to do an a tag and then we're good. 28. Forgot what I did. And the color will be Alice blue, just so it stands out. Keeps with our blue color theme. All right, that's that. Now let's head on over to here. And yeah, look at that. Not the most beautiful, but it's all right. So this is just to showcase here really that, you know, we've got these hashed class names from style components. It just works. And usually style components works pretty easy because it's just JavaScript. But it's worth showing. And it's got all of these vendor prefixes. These actually aren't coming from PostCSS. Style components comes with them. So if you didn't have PostCSS installed, these would, you know, be here automatically. But I'm not going to waste your time showing you that. So let's add a quick link here. We'll do it above the image so we don't have to scroll down. So here I'll just do an anchor tag. And we'll go we're going to go to view.html just so we can bounce around. Go to the view app. And then I guess we also want slash index.html. Home. And isn't this cool? Like you've really easily between that beautiful gradient, you've really easily between all of this are just jumping around between all of these different React apps through multiple entry points are different JavaScript frameworks with a React app with a view app. Sorry, I was reading the text and it got in my head. You go to React app, you go to the view app, you go to the home. And that's really neat. It was pretty easy to set all this stuff up and a lot of it was real magical. So wild. I think that's pretty good. Let's commit that for a moment. So we'll say add React. Or no, we added style components, we already added React, right? Now it's really briefly, this will be fast, but I want people to know how to do this. Let's change it to TypeScript, React TypeScript. So all we need to do here is rename these files TSX. And then we'll rename this. Now, if you didn't have TypeScript already set up, it would actually detect this and it would automatically install it just so you know, and that's really cool. The index or the React HTML, we're going to have to change that to TSX. Okay. So there is one thing that you have to do here. Let's go back to index TSS. And you'll notice when you go into this, VS Code is actually telling you cannot use JSX without the dash dash JSX flag. Now that's because you have this empty TSS TS config. And when we, where's my, thought I had it on my clipboard. When you paste this, you need compiler options JSX React in order for that to work. Now, that's all you need. You go back to app, it's working fine. This will still be an error because that whole, you know, when you're importing images or CSS, it doesn't know what type that is. But it is now working and running. So let's make sure we change the file name. So of course, we have to restart the server. What did I mess up? app JSX. Oh, that's weird. It's app dot TSX. It should, it doesn't need the extension. It'll get mad if you do that. It sorted itself out. It was really weird. I just guess I just have to save the file again. It is I think it's just really aggressively caching this stuff to save build time, which sometimes is annoying. But I think you can disable that. Anyways, there we go. Reload the page, go to the React app. Oh, and our apps broken. That's not Bono. Oh, I think I might not have saved that. That's probably why I didn't update. Oh, I'm sorry about that. So here we go. Everything's working just fine. And we still have state and all that beautiful stuff. So that puts us done with that. But you you might want to see just really briefly, you know, some of the actual React TypeScript stuff working. So this will be super fast. I'll say typography equals a function that takes children. And it spreads its props because we're going to need the action off of that. And maybe you want to send class names or whatever. And then here we'll do an h2. Spread props onto it. Normally, you shouldn't do this. But if you're doing a component library, you might. It's getting a little long there, isn't it? No, you won't format that for me. Can you do jerk? Okay, so we have this typography. And now we're going to swap out this h2 for that. I don't know why I didn't change both my tags. And you'll see that we get a TypeScript error here. And it'll say property children is missing in type and then it's got the type whoops, on click any etc. And that's because you know, you need to do something like this, however you want to do it.

And there you go. So I just want to show that TypeScript, you know, working in IntelliSense, they're same thing as before, it's Babel. So it's not actually going to fail to build, you get it. So there you have it, TypeScript and React. So let's add all this stuff here. We had to change this ts config. That was pretty much the only thing and I wanted you to see that. So that you know that that is a minimum requirement. Add TypeScript and React. Okay, and I think a great way to wrap this up is to add Svelte to top it all off here. So we will go through this process real quick. We're going to copy the React page, we're going to paste that, we're going to rename it Svelte.html, you can name it whatever you want, of course. And we'll go up here. Svelte app goes here. I probably could just change that one word, huh? Stop being dumb. And here we might as well put some links. And we'll say we want to go to React app. I'm going to be lazy and just put view app, whatever. React view. We still got our root. I don't think we're going to need that, actually. I'll leave it anyways, though. And then here we're going to go to Svelte. And this is going to be index. And don't forget that's just a JS file coming up. And then we can go over here to our sidebar. And I will create at the source level a new folder. And this folder is going to be Svelte. Svelte. It's hard to type. Index.js. Did I put that in the right spot? Yeah, I did. And then I also need to add another file here. And that's going to be app.svelte. We're just going to use the same pattern. And this stuff I will paste for you to make it a little bit faster. Okay, so we're going to be importing the app. This is just a normal way to set up a Svelte app. We just target document.body. And the only difference is we're passing a prop here with the name Svelte. Then in our app Svelte, we will paste all of this code in here. And it should install that automatically. It might have. Let's check our package.json to see if it updated. It did not. Ah, yes, that's right. So let me very first go over really briefly the code in here so you can see what it's doing. And then I'm going to show you how Svelte takes a tiny bit more setup. Not much. But there is another gotcha. So we have a script tag. This is the normal business. We're exporting let name. And that is how Svelte is going to bind to that name or be able to pass that prop in. We have a count. We have a handle click. Nothing crazy. We have some styles, which Svelte does scope as well. And then we have this HTML here. And we just have an on click handle. And then you can see we're going to do this cute little logic you don't really need to pay too much attention to. But it's basically just to say how many times the click was counted and to have a little face. And you'll see it in a moment. And then we have our RLR links. Right. And I guess that's I don't know why I put those in here. I shouldn't even have those in here. I should have them in here. I'm a dummy. And what's kind of cool, I just want to show this is like, let's say that you got rid of the button. You'll actually get some nice little helper stuff from Svelte automatically just because VS Code and it will tell you that this thing is unused. And I really like that about Svelte. It's really dope. OK, so it's not working. Right. And I'll just let you know, even if we restart it, it's not going to make a difference. OK, this is one of the ones that, well, go over here. NPM start. It ran some stuff. You know, don't take my word for it. I'll just show you that. Right. I thought I put a link to Svelte. Now, let me do that real fast. React. Why can't I type that? Such a weird word. Svelte app. See, the monkey learned. Now go to the Svelte app real quick and you can see it's not loading. All right. So what's going on here is we actually do have to install this one. It doesn't auto detect it. And I might know why, but we want to add Svelte and then we need to add this parcel plugin Svelte and then also a parcel bundler. I think it's just parcel bundler. Not sure why. So we're going to install that and I will briefly show you in the docs. If you come over to Svelte. There we go. They tell you to install these as well. Parcel bundle or parcel plugin Svelte and then parcel bundler. Now, when I run this, though, it's going to get upset. I'll just briefly tell you that this. So what this is, is it's kind of a funny predicament. This also took me a little bit to figure out. So this is that the parcel plugin Svelte, the maintainer, I believe, didn't tag the newest version that fixes this error. And it's from many months ago. And so even if you do. So I'll do npm i dash d. Parcel plugin Svelte. And I'll do at latest. OK, I want to show that when I do that and I go to my package JSON. Parcel plugin Svelte is at 406 currently and multiple people prodded them to update the tag because they actually took the time and fixed the bug, but they didn't. The package is up on npm, but it doesn't show up. So you actually have to type it in manually and say 4.0.8. And there you go. That's that. And then when we do npm start. This was from an update to Svelte. I shouldn't say recent because it was like six months ago. So that ran. Go back over to here. And there we go. Now it's working. So, you know, before I move on, I don't want to, you know, be crapping all over this open source dev. Obviously, he's doing it for free. We should be grateful for his work. But it wasn't annoyance that I ran into just because they hadn't taken the time to tag it. But, you know, life happens. Who knows what's going on in his life. So thank you for all the work you do. Nameless soldier. So, oh, hi, Svelte. Here we go. And you can see we have this very upset face because we haven't clicked the button yet. Click the button. There's now a jolly face. Click there. There you go. You got a Svelte app. You've got a React app. You've got, you know, a Vue app. You can click things. All the different things, all sorts of setup and configuration in this. And I was actually going to show Tailwind with it, but there are more of those post CSS 8 difficulties that, like I said, the Vue 3 community had problems with it as well, and they had it with Tailwind, and that's how I learned about it. So I decided it would just, you know, lengthen the video too much, and I think you get the gist. I'll link this in the description just so you know. But how you get it working is there's this post CSS 7 compatibility build that Tailwind has because they talk all about it in this little article here. Like I said, I'll link it. And so it's a known issue. It's not necessarily Parcel's fault here. Like I said, Vue has the problem as well, and I'm sure other things do. So I won't go through setting that up. I'll just give you the link. And with that, I think we can call it here. I think we've seen a lot of the power of Parcel and how cool it is. And I know Parcel 2 is somewhere around the corner. I thought about waiting for it, but, you know, it was in alpha for like a year and beta in half a year. It's been a really long time. They've been doing a ton of cool work for it. There's all sorts of stuff to be excited about. But if you want to get in and use Parcel right now, you can see that it's pretty dang cool. I know we really breezed through a lot of content there really quickly, but I hope it showcased a lot of the really cool functionalities of Parcel, and maybe you'll be interested in using it for any of your projects. I haven't actually used it as an entire, like, enterprise project yet, but I'm really wanting to try that. But I use it for development stuff all the time because it's just really fast to set up, and I think it can get you really far. So, you know, you might not want to worry about setting up all the cool, crazy webpack stuff if you just want to kind of get going and start working on stuff right now. And, you know, if you have problems down the line, you can convert it to something else later. But I think it's really worth using. I hope you enjoyed this video, and I hope to see you in the next video.", "name": "parcel.txt", "vector": [0.01321988832205534, 0.01111795287579298, -0.010354227386415005, 0.0012951232492923737,
