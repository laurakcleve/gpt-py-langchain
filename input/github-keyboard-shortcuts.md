Just a quick tip here that most programmers I meet haven't seen before so I thought it'd be cool to share. Github has a handy little reminder of keyboard shortcuts if you type "`?`".

## Fuzzy search!?

But that isn't even the coolest part. If you press "`t`" while in a repository, it opens up the file finder, which is a fuzzy search if you are more familiar with that term. It's super fast to find files that contain a phrase or path by simply typing it in. You can press enter if the result you want is at the top, and it will take you to that file.

I love this feature and I think more people should know about it, so give it a swing.
